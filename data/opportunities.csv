INFORMATION RESOURCES ON HOW TO REGISTER TO BE ELIGIBLE AS A CONTRACTOR WITH THE US GOVERNMENT In order to do business with the US Government as a contractor, a company must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM, www.sam.gov). In order to register on SAM, a company must obtain a NCAGE code and a “Unique Entity ID” number (UEI). You can apply for an NCAGE code and a UEI number simultaneously, but both must be obtained in order to register on SAM. 11. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO REGISTER TO BE ELIGIBLE AS A CONTRACTOR WITH THE US GOVERNMENT: NCAGE Code. An NCAGE code is a five-character ID number used by the US Government to identify international companies. All non-US firms must obtain an NCAGE code. How does your company obtain an NCAGE Code? If you are a vendor located outside the United States, one can be obtained at no cost by visiting https://eportal.nspa.nato.int/AC135Public/CageTool/home. Further information about NCAGE codes is available at https://eportal.nspa.nato.int/AC135Public/Docs/US%20Instructions%20for%20NSPA%20NCAGE.pdf. Look for “NCAGE Code Request Tool” or “NCRT”; Generally it takes approximately 24-48 hours to obtain an NCAGE code. Unique Entity ID (UEI): Go to https://sam.gov/content/home and click on “Get Started” under “Register your Entity”. UEI has replaced the DUNS number in many ways and business entities will need one in order to register on SAM.gov and to do business with the US Government: https://www.fsd.gov/gsafsd_sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0037033&sys_kb_id=07a22df51b6ec554cc45ea04bc4bcbda&spa=1 SAM Registration. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a registration database required for all US Federal Government Contracts and where you will find contract opportunities all over the world. You can register on SAM at: SAM.gov | Home For additional help at no cost, contact the Federal Service Desk at www.fsd.gov or by telephone at +1-866-606-8220 (toll free) or +1-334-206-7828 (internationally). Generally it takes approximately two weeks for SAM to activate a registration, from the date it receives a completed registration. Please take notice that SAM has an entity registration requirement that firms submit an ""original, signed notarized letter before the registration will be activated."" Instructions for international entities (not located in the U.S. or its outlying areas) can be found at: https://sam.gov/content/entity-registration."

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.5 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.6 Security Clearance Required - This contract/purchase order requires the Contractor to have a Government Security Clearance in accordance with the attached Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254). 3.7 First Article Approval (Government Testing) - First Article Test (FAT) and approval is required. 3.7.1 ;per ISEA, First Article Testing is required to determine quality of work for potential vendor qualification.

Section 8205 supersedes the temporary authority granted to the Forest Service (Government) in section 347 of Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999. Stewardship authority grants the Forest Service the authority to aggregate stewardship work activity requirements and solicit those requirements utilizing full and open competition. Project Location: The BCLH Stewardship IRSC Phase 3 project is located approximately 1 to 5 miles west of Detroit, OR within the burn scars of the Beachie Creek Fire and Lionshead Fire, both of which occurred in 2020. Portions of the Contract area also fall within the Opal Creek Wilderness and Scenic Recreation Area (16 U.S. Code § 545b). The total project area is 1,843 acres in size and is located on the Detroit Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest. Access to the project is via FSR 46. The ground to be treated is within Sec 23-28, 32-34 & 36, T08S, R04E; Sec 31, T08S, R05E; Sec 2-5, & 11, T09S, R04E; Sec 6-8, 13-17, 20-26, 28, 35, & 36, T09S, R05E; Sec 19-29, T09S, R06E; Willamette Meridian, Surveyed & Unsurveyed, Marion County, Oregon. See maps included as attachments to the solicitation. These maps are geo-referenced for practical application using Avenza. Shapefiles have also been provided in a zip folder. A shapefile is a simple, nontopological format for storing geometric location and attributes information of geographic features. GIS (Geographic Information System) software is required to open and view these files. Period of Performance: The effective period of this contract is from date of award through 10/15/2029. Staggered deadlines apply to the Mandatory and Optional work. Fish logs shall be delivered to the designated deck locations not later than 10/15/2026. After careful consideration, it was determined that no operations shall occur between October 16 – May 14 except as detailed for Unit BC-4. See Section F of the solicitation for all completion deadlines and timing restrictions. Scope of Contract: The objectives of this project are to reduce the risks of hazardous fuels that have fallen across or remain standing along important access routes of the 2020 fire-affected road system so that access to and through the burned area can be restored. Fire severity varied across the treatment areas; burn severity maps and tables are included for planning purposes. Activities include performing mitigation of risk along roads from fire killed/damaged trees, reduction of roadside fuel accumulation and essential maintenance and reconstruction of roads. This will be done by accomplishing the following: • Cut and remove fire killed timber within 100 feet of roads from the Contract Area. Hazard trees to be cut are Designated by Prescription. Mechanized equipment shall operate on existing road prisms only (bottom of ditch to base of outside fill slope). • Fall hazard trees within Special Measure Areas (SMAs). SMAs may include Riparian Reserves, cultural resource areas, wildlife habitat protection areas or other areas that requires special protections such as the Opal Creek Scenic Recreation Area. This work is located within 100 feet of the road. SMAs do not overlap acres that require the cutting and removal of fire killed trees. • Within unit boundaries, fall and leave hazard trees that can strike the road outside of the 100-foot fuels removal area. • Perform small fuels treatment within 30 feet of roads. • Perform road reconstruction within the Contract Area. • Perform pre-haul, during-haul and post-haul road maintenance on designated roads within the Contract Area. • Yard and deliver fish logs to specified deck locations. • Fall and leave individual hazard trees that are outside of unit boundary but within striking distance of the road. Supplemental NEPA: The Willamette National Forest staff is currently working on a Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA) to reduce risks to forest workers; the anticipated decision date in Spring 2025. The proposed action change would allow off-road ground-based equipment operations to implement the remaining work of the 2020 Fire Affected Road System Risk Reduction Project on approximately 950 total acres within the previously authorized treatment area of the Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fire. If approved, equipment would be authorized to operate on flatter ground (generally less than 30% slope) where the direction a tree falls is less predictable or controlled and the impacts to soil resources are limited and consistent with Forest Plan standards. Approximately 135 acres may be available for off-road, ground-based equipment use in Phase 3 of the BCLH IRSC. If a final decision is made for the Supplemental EA during the solicitation period, an amendment shall be issued to allow equipment operation outside the road prism subject to specific technical requirements. In no instance would an amendment of this type be executed without approval of the Supplemental EA. Estimated Timber Volume and Species composition is as follows: Forest product volume estimates for the cut and removal of fire killed trees is provided below. Volume quantities are made available with the understanding that values shown are Forest Service estimates and are not guaranteed. Interested Contractors are urged to examine the individual contract areas and make their own estimates. Approved LIDAR and RAV data has been used to determine volume on the BCLH Stewardship IRSC Phase 3. Mandatory Acres - Cut and Remove Fire Killed Timber within 100’ of the road: 190 acres - 16,850 volume (TONS) Optional Acres - Cut and Remove Fire Killed Timber within 100’ of the road: 199 acres - 23,622 volume (TONS). Site Visit Date and Time: The Forest held a site visit in the fall of 2024 for prospective contractors to facilitate dialogue on contractual requirements that are anticipated in the contract and any operational limitations foreseen by attendees. Another site visit will be held on Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. PDT with the initial meeting location at Detroit Ranger Station, 44125 North Santiam Highway SE, Detroit, OR 97342. Contractors shall email Karen Ruklic by noon on Monday, March 31, 2025, if they are planning to attend the meeting. Vendors that wish to view the site independently will need an approved Road Use Permit. Review the Project Area Access Instructions provided.

The contract shall be awarded using a best value source selection method. Technical Proposals are required; see Sections L and M of the solicitation for instructions and evaluation details. The resulting contract shall be a firm, fixed price contract. Service Contract Act and Construction (Davis Bacon) Wage Determinations apply and have been provided as attachments to the solicitation. Construction Bonding: A bid bond or other acceptable bid guarantee valued at 20% of the construction total price offered (all Mandatory and Optional Items combined) shall be required and submitted with the initial offer.

Follow this notice on sam.gov for future notifications. Total Project Planning Solicitation Timing: The BCLH Stewardship IRSC was broken into 3 phases based on geographic locations of roads planned for treatment. Phase 3 was prioritized higher due to partnership and budgetary considerations. For this reason, Phase 3 was solicited first. The plan at this time is to issue Phase 2 next. Phase 1 will be solicited last due to the fact that one of the major haul roads needed is currently planned for reconstruction in the summer of 2025. Update 3/13/2025 - new Attachment 4b Appendix D Road Reconstruction Plans was uploaded. Original document was corrupted. No changes were made to the body of the signed plans. The version dated 3/13/2025 shall be incorporated into the awarded contract. Amendment 0001 was issued on 3/26/25 to implement 2 FAR class deviations to ensure compliance with Executive Orders issued since 1/20/2025. Offerors must acknowledge receipt of this amendment as detailed on the SF 30 and utilize the amended version of Provision K.2 when submitting offers."

Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.beta.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer – System for Award Management, which indicates “All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).” Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.beta.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.beta.SAM.gov. Refer to www.beta.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg. Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected. ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration. Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM. Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov)."

There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=EOC Submit at the time of material delivery a Certificate of Compliance per DI-MISC-81356 to NAVSUP-WSS code N9433. A separate Certificate of Compliance shall be prepared and submitted for each unique combination of Contract/Purchase Order Number, National Stock Number and Item Nomenclature specified in the schedule of Supply/Services.

Only white papers will be accepted as initial submissions; formal proposals will be accepted by invitation only. While white papers will be considered if received prior to 1600 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 21 MAY 2029, the following submission dates are suggested to best align with projected funding: FY25 by 15 Jun 2024 (Please note: For FY25, AFRL is seeking whitepapers for TA1 ONLY; further, see Figure 2 on page 7; for FY25, AFRL will only consider components in WHITE; TA2 and TA1 SHADED components will not be considered for FY25. FY26 by 15 Jun 2025 FY27 by 15 Jun 2026 FY28 by 15 Jun 2027 FY29 by 15 Jun 2028 Offerors should monitor the Contract Opportunities on the SAM website at https://SAM.gov in the event this announcement is amended. CONCISE SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT: This BAA is seeking innovative research to develop a capability to continuously orchestrate command and control (C2) processes in an Agile Combat Employment (ACE) operational environment through distributed workflow execution. We are particularly interested in approaches to orchestrate the execution of distributed workflows that adhere to maintaining flexibility, while adapting to a dynamic operational environment. The Air Force plans to complicate the adversary’s targeting problem through the distribution of forces to increase survivability and maintain functionality. Successful distributed C2 operations will rely on distributed control and decentralized execution, with an assumption that specific conditional authorities will be delegated to lower tier nodes. As the Air Force transitions from monolithic C2 nodes to many distributed nodes, it will require a capability to execute distributed C2 workflows across multiple locations while maintaining awareness of changing states to functions, resources, and mission objectives. The Coordinating Austere Nodes through Virtualization and Analysis of Streams (CANVAS) program proposes to meet these demand signals by designing and developing a system prototype that assumes contested and degraded environments will be normal for executing distributed operations. The CANVAS program proposes to develop a system for distributed task execution that includes a virtual C2 layer (TA1) to realize the concept of maintaining centralized command in distributed operations and a decentralized C2 framework (TA2) to support the execution of workflows across many physically dispersed C2 nodes. Virtualizing the C2 layer will allow AF command nodes to conduct tradeoff analysis of business rule changes and conditions-based authorities, through simulating the execution of dynamic workflows under operationally relevant conditions, before pushing changes that align with commander’s intent into the decentralized C2 framework. Populating downstream changes from the command node that achieve intent of the system, will allow distributed teams to execute local workflows through trust, shared awareness, and understanding of commander’s intent. Orchestrating these changes through intent-based networking concepts will achieve real-time tracking of the downstream effects within the workflows and graphs of the decentralized C2 framework. The TA2 execution framework fills a critical operational gap within ACE by realizing the full utilization of capacity of operational and tactical C2 elements while increasing the resiliency of these same elements. TA2 will research and develop the ability to orchestrate operational processes, while optimizing for limited resources in a contested environment. BAA ESTIMATED FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200K to $3M. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount. ANTICIPATED INDIVIDUAL AWARDS: Multiple Awards are anticipated. However, the Air Force reserves the right to award zero, one, or more Procurement Contracts, Other Transactions, or Assistance Instruments, for all, some, or none of the solicited effort based on the offeror’s ability to perform desired work and funding fluctuations. There is no limit on the number of OTs that may be awarded to an individual offeror. TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE AWARDED: FAR based Procurement contracts, CFR based grants and cooperative agreements or other transactions (OT) under 10 USC 4021, 10 USC 4022 ( previously 10 USC 4002, 2371, 10 USC 4003, 2371b) depending upon the nature of the work proposed. 10 USC 4023 also allows for FAR based contracts, OTs for research, OTs for Prototype, and assistance instruments. In the event that an Other Transaction for Prototype agreement is awarded as a result of this competitive BAA, and the prototype project is successfully completed, there is the potential for a prototype project to transition to award of a follow-on production contract or transaction. The Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement itself will also contain a similar notice of a potential follow-on production contract or agreement.

This Solicitation is being issued under EAF Authority formally known as SEPA. For Critical Safety Items (CSI), DFARS clause 252.209-7010, Identification of Critical Safety Items, is incorporated by reference. For items for which Government inspection and acceptance will be conducted at the source, DLAD clause 52.?-9004, Product Verification Testing, is incorporated by reference. DLAD clauses can be viewed at http://www.dla.mil/Acquisition/Pages/DLAD.aspx. As applicable, DFARS clause 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, is incorporated by reference. Drawings are not available for this Request For Quote. Offerors are advised that offers received from sources which are not government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore ineligible for award. Any distributors of approved sources MUST submit a copy of their authorized distributor letter, on the source letterhead, to the buyer point of contact indicated on the solicitation via email, at time of proposal submittal. All potential offers shall provide newly manufactured spares only. Refurbished, remanufactured, or repaired material will not be acceptable. Offers for such are ineligible for award. NAVSUP WSS Code N2 has determined that the requirements at DFARS 211.274 which mandates the use of DFARS clause 252.211-7003 ""Item Unique Identification and Valuation"" in all solicitations and contracts, be deleted from all non-CLSSA FMS spares requirements processed by NAVSUP WSS and DLA-Aviation. The affected parts are wholly owned by FMS customer countries, are not covered by a Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA), these same assets will be delivered to the customer country for their sole use. The IUID definition at DFARS 211.274-1 says IUID ""is a system of marking, valuing and tracking items delivered to DoD."" These spares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered to DoD. The assets are delivered to a domestic U.S. freight forwarder who is under contract by the FMS customer to ship the assets to the country of record. The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assets to be specially marked for tracking by DoD. Quotes/proposals received from sources which are not Government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore ineligible for award. Quotes/proposals from dealers/distributors for government approved source(s) MUST submit a copy of their authorized distributor letter (on the actual manufacturer's letterhead) to the buyer/point of contact indicated on the solicitation via email, at time of quote/proposal submittal."

The government’s anticipated magnitude of this requirement is as follows: $400k to $500k aggregate estimated value (5-years) for this requirement 3.0 Background 3.1 The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is the official export credit agency of the United States. EXIM is an independent Executive Branch agency with a mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services. When private sector lenders are unable or unwilling to provide financing, EXIM fills in the gap for American businesses by equipping them with the financing tools necessary to compete for global sales. In doing so, the agency levels the playing field for U.S. goods and services going up against foreign competition in overseas markets, so that American companies can create better-paying American jobs. Because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, EXIM assumes credit and country risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept. The agency's charter requires that all transactions it authorizes demonstrate a reasonable assurance of repayment; EXIM consistently maintains a low default rate and closely monitors credit and other risks in its portfolio.

This RFI will address the availability of non-proprietary, Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and technical engineering services to support this initiative. Description: The U.S. Army Contracting Command – Rock Island (ACC-RI) is seeking potential sources and information related to a possible acquisition for Next Generation Transponders (NGT) across the suite of cellular and satellite transponders with world-wide coverage that support logistics and asset in-transit visibility. Products: Under an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, the Contractor shall provide transponders capable of the following: activate, commission, decommission, deactivate, reuse, and track assets from point A to point B world-wide. The Army seeks to acquire products which may include, but is not limited to: Battery-Operated Cellular Transponder(s) Battery-Operated Satellite Transponder(s) Battery-Operated Hybrid Transponder(s) (cellular and satellite) Goal: This RFI is to gather Industry comments and advice on products to support DoD’s interests in Next Generation Transponders (NGT) for asset tracking through the use of cellular, satellite, and hybrid transponders. Industry responses will be used by the Government to refine the scope of the potential future requirements for described products. Companies are encouraged not to include marketing informational materials that do not relate to the products / services described in this RFI, however, responses may include URL links to technical documentation materials (i.e., technical data sheets). The Government is seeking answers from Industry for the following questions: How long is the current expected battery life of cellular transponders operating with 1 ping every two hours while in motion / 1 ping every four hours at rest? How long is the current expected battery life of satellite transponders operating with 1 ping every two hours while in motion / 1 ping every four hours at rest? How long is the current expected battery life of hybrid transponders operating with 1 ping every two hours while in motion / 1 ping every four hours at rest? What are the benefits and limitations of satellite vs cellular vs hybrid transponders? How do low / high temperature extreme conditions impact the ability to operate transponders world-wide? Are devices capable of using a mandated 14 numeric character transponder ID? What additional characteristics are available to ID transponders? Are transponders compliant with ISO/IEC 18000 or other standards? What is the price range for current cellular, satellite, and hybrid (cellular / satellite) transponders? What other costs are associated with purchasing each type of transponder, examples: activation, network access, and a data plan (one ping every two hours while in motion / one ping every four hours while at rest for a minimum of 120 days) for a period of two years. Are devices on any other Government contract vehicles? Are services plans able to be obtained from other sources? What is the average lead time from order to delivery on an order of 100, 500, 1000, 5000 transponders? Are there any identified supply chain risks related to manufacturing? What types of encryption capabilities are available for satellite/cellular transponders? What, if any, methods are used by transponders to identify the battery state of charge and, when needed, to fully charge the transponders before use? Are transponders’ capable of using common USB-C, wireless, solar-power or other common off the shelf charger to recharge batteries? Can transponder data be sent directly to a DoD server or middleware? What methods does Industry recommend for aggregating transponder data from multiple sources? Are transponders capable of using a dedicated, secure DoD Iridium gateway narrowband device capability via Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (EMSS)? Are transponders capable of communication without external antenna protrusions? Are currently available off the shelf transponders tested and certified to meet DoD standards for hazards of electromagnetic radiation for ordnance, people and fuel (HERO/HERP/HERF)? Are transponders M-Code compliant? Is industry willing to become M-Code compliant? What are the cost impacts to being M-Code compliant? What different methods are transponders able to be attached to assets? Are any special tools required? Can cellular capable transponders communicate using, at a minimum, 5G/4G LTE networks with 3G/2G network fallback coverage? Is there an ability for remote sleep, temporal fencing, and geo fencing? What capabilities exist for transponders to be turned on, off or standby? Are there any countries that are known to disallow use of cellular towers or restrict satellite communication? Can users set the priority order of communication for a hybrid satellite/cellular transponder or is there a standard protocol? Can a single transponder be used for rail, land, sea and air? What other types of tagging technology does Industry recommend to the Government that can provide in-transit visibility with examples of how they are being employed by customers? Some examples might be Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), mesh technology, etc. RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: All interested companies that possess the capabilities addressed herein are encouraged to respond via email to the RFI by providing the information requested within this announcement to the following: Mr. John Kerch, john.d.kerch.civ@army.mil and Mr. Benjamin Geringer, benjamin.l.geringer.civ@army.mil Please ensure the Subject Line contains the following: ""Company Name – Cage Code – NGT RFI #2 – Date Submitting the Email”"

SEE ATTACHED AMENDMENT 00001 FOR DETAILS **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** BACKGROUND This is a CONTRACT (hereinafter ""Contract"") between the U.S. Agency for Global Media (hereinafter referred to as the ""USAGM""), an entity of the Government of the United States of America, with its headquarters located at 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, 20237, U.S.A. and (TBD) (hereinafter ""Contractor""). STATEMENT OF WORK The requirement of this contract is to provide Facilities Maintenance Support at the USAGM Philippines Transmitting Station located in Tinang, Concepcion, Tarlac. The contractor shall provide a broad range of maintenance services to support the ongoing operations of the facility. The Statement of Work is as follows: Electrician Services – Regular inspection, maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair of the facility's electrical systems, ensuring safety, efficiency, and compliance with electrical codes and standards. Air Conditioning (HVAC) Maintenance and Repair – Scheduled preventive maintenance and corrective repair of air conditioning systems, including split-type units, chillers, cassette multi-zoned HVAC systems, and ventilation equipment to maintain optimal indoor air quality and temperature control. Real Property Maintenance & Repair – General upkeep and repair of all physical infrastructure, including building exteriors, roofing, walls, flooring, ceilings, windows, and doors. Work shall also include minor renovations, carpentry, painting, and masonry as required. Household Equipment & Appliances Maintenance – Periodic inspection and servicing of facility-owned household appliances, including but not limited to refrigerators, ovens, washing machines, dryers, and kitchen equipment. Plumbing Services – Maintenance and repair of all plumbing systems and fixtures, ensuring the proper operation of water supply and drainage systems. The facility contains approximately 95 plumbing fixtures across multiple buildings, requiring routine inspections, leak detection, unclogging, replacement of damaged components, and compliance with water efficiency standards. Warehouse Support – Inventory management, logistics assistance, and maintenance of storage areas, ensuring proper organization and safekeeping of equipment, tools, and materials essential for facility operations. Maintenance & Repair of Government-Owned Vehicles (GOVs), Heavy Equipment, Utility Vehicles (UTVs), and Gasoline/ Diesel-Powered Tools – Routine servicing, preventive maintenance, and necessary repairs to ensure operational readiness and safety compliance of government-owned vehicles and equipment. Temporary Additional Maintenance Services – On an as-needed basis, the contractor may be required to provide supplemental maintenance services beyond the standard scope outlined above. These services will be determined by operational requirements and facility needs. Emergency Maintenance Services – The contractor shall provide additional maintenance services as required by the facility. These services will be project-specific and may include emergency repairs, short-term labor support, or other operational needs outside of the regular maintenance schedule. The contractor is expected to have qualified personnel, tools, and resources necessary to execute these services efficiently while adhering to industry best practices, safety standards, and government regulations. This facility includes the buildings shown in the following chart, the contractor will be required to maintain the rooms as identified in Attachment 6. All services shall be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work, terms and conditions, and attachments included in this contract and all applicable FAR clauses, regulations, standards, attachments and other documents referenced herein. PURPOSE: The maintenance of the building is essential for ensuring its long-term functionality, safety, and efficiency. A well- maintained facility not only preserves its structural integrity but also enhances the overall operational effectiveness of the organization it serves. The key objectives of building maintenance include: Ensuring Safety and Usability – Proper maintenance ensures that all building systems, including electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and structural components, remain in safe working condition. Regular inspections and repairs help prevent potential hazards such as electrical failures, leaks, water damage, or structural deterioration, safeguarding the well-being of employees, and visitors. Extending the Longevity of Assets – Consistent upkeep of critical infrastructure, equipment, and building components reduces wear and tear, ultimately prolonging the lifespan of assets. Preventative maintenance strategies, such as routine servicing, calibration, and condition monitoring, prevent premature degradation and extend the operational life of essential systems. Optimizing Asset Performance – A well-maintained facility enables all mechanical, electrical, and structural components to operate at their highest efficiency levels. Properly functioning HVAC systems, lighting, and plumbing improve indoor air quality, energy efficiency, and overall workplace productivity. Avoiding Unscheduled Downtime – Proactive maintenance minimizes the likelihood of sudden equipment failures, system breakdowns, or emergency repairs that could disrupt daily operations. This ensures continuous service availability, especially in mission-critical facilities where downtime can lead to operational setbacks and financial losses. Minimizing Operational Costs – Routine maintenance is cost-effective compared to reactive repairs or emergency replacements. Preventing small issues from escalating into major failures reduces repair expenses, conserves resources, and minimizes disruptions that could impact productivity. Proper asset management also helps in energy conservation, reducing long-term utility costs. Enhancing Compliance with Regulations – Regular maintenance ensures that the building meets local, national, and international building codes, safety standards, and environmental regulations. Compliance with fire safety protocols, electrical standards, and occupational health regulations reduces legal liabilities and improves workplace safety. Preserving Property Value – Maintaining the building’s physical structure, aesthetics, and functionality enhances its market value and ensures that it remains a valuable asset for the organization.

The Government is requesting a Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT) of: 366 days after receipt of asset. Repair Turnaround Time (RTAT) definition: The resultant contractual delivery requirement is measured from asset Return to the date of asset acceptance under the terms of the contract. For purposes of this section, Return is defined as physical receipt of the F-condition asset at the contractor's facility as reflected in the Action Date entry in the Commercial Asset Visibility (CAV) system. In accordance with the CAV Statement of Work, the contractor is required to accurately report all transactions by the end of the fifth regular business day after receipt and the Action Date entered in CAV must be dated to reflect the actual date of physical receipt. The Contractor must obtain final inspection and acceptance by the Government for all assets within the RTATs established in this contract. Please note freight is handled by Navy CAV or Proxy CAV as stated in NAVSUPWSSFA24 or NAVSUPWSSFA25. Throughput Constraint: Contractor must provide a throughput Constraint for each NSN(s). Total assets to be repaired monthly after initial delivery commences: _____/month (contractor is to fill in #). A throughput of ""0"" (zero) per month reflects no throughput constraint.

Any asset received after this date in days is not authorized for repair without bi-lateral agreement between the Contractor and NAVSUP WSS Contracting Officer. H. IMPORTANT NOTE: Reconciliation Price Reduction: Any asset(s) for which the contractor does not meet the required RTAT will incur a price reduction per unit/per month the contractor is late. However, any delay determined to be excusable (e.g. Government Delay) will not result in a price reduction. If the contractor does not meet the required RTAT due to inexcusable contractor delay, the Contracting Officer will implement the aforementioned price reduction via a ""Reconciliation Modification"" at the end of the contract performance. Price reductions made pursuant to this section shall not limit other remedies available to the Government for failure to meet required RTATs, including but not limited to the Government's right to terminate for default. In reference to the above important note, the contractor provides the following price reduction amount per unit/per month the contractor does not meet the RTAT: $___________, up to a maximum of: $__________.

Only those sources for this item currently approved by the Government will be considered for this award. The time required for approval of a new supplier is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of the new source. Qualification and testing requirements are extensive and time consuming. To maintain appropriate stock levels and prevent work stoppage, a prospective contractor must be determined to be qualified by the engineering activity prior to submitting offer. If you have not been solicited and you can furnish either (a) proof of your prior approval as a supplier of this item, or (b) data showing you have produced the same or similar items satisfactorily for the Government or a commercial source, or (c) test data indicating your product can meet service operating requirements, or (d) other pertinent data concerning your qualification to produce the required item, notify the Procurement Contracting Officer in writing, furnishing said proof of data for evaluation, possibly leading to your firm being authorized as an approved source for this procurement or subsequent procurements. Your interest will be forwarded to the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) responsible for this item.; 3.2.1 ;Current government approved Sources for this material are the following: CAGE 1K3G5, MARINE POLYMERS INCC CAGE 0SX38, WESTLAND TECHNOLOGIES INCC CAGE 0BBK9, Goodrich Corporation (Collins Aerospace); 3.3 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with MIL-STD-130. 3.4 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the SPCC Contracting Officer has been notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.5 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.6 Security Clearance Required - This contract/purchase order requires the Contractor to have a Government Security Clearance in accordance with the attached Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254). 3.7 First Article Approval (Government Testing) - First Article Test (FAT) and approval is required. 3.7.1 ;per ISEA, First Article Testing is required to determine quality of work for potential vendor qualification. FAT will be conducted at contractor expense.

The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparing and/or submitting information in response to this posting. The Government may utilize the information provided in response to this posting to develop its Acquisition Strategy (AS), Statement of Work (SOW)/Statement of Objectives (SOO), and/or Performance Specifications (PS). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained within their response as instructed later in this posting. Purpose: The United States (U.S.) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance & Special Operations Forces (ISR & SOF) Directorate, Special Warfare (SW) Program Office (PO) (AFLCMC/WISN) and Contracting Office (AFLCMC/WISK) are conducting market research to identify possible sources capable of providing Tactical Communications Equipment and Training. This RFI/Sources Sought is issued for informational purposes and market research only and does not constitute a solicitation or commitment of the Government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information in response to this posting is voluntary and participants will not be compensated for preparation costs. Requirement Background and Scope: USAF Dismounted Operators conduct hi-intensity missions demanding constant Situational Awareness (SA) in a dynamic battlefield environment. These operations include but are not limited to Tactical control of Airborne Strike Assets, Personnel Recovery, Special Tactics (ST), Digital Force Protection (DFP) and Assault Zone Operations. Currently, operators maintain SA through a System of Systems (SoS) that includes hand-held radios, GPS positioning, and hand-held sensors, all connected through a power and data hub to an End User Device (EUD). The Special Tactics (ST) Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) requires the ability to conduct radio testing and participating in exercises in support of tasked SOF core activities. The Radio Equipment Systems enabling Special Tactics Special Reconnaissance, Integrated Fires, and Sensitive Activities (SA) operations. Currently AFLCMC/WISN has a decentralized ordering system for all tactical communications equipment and no ability to procure additional trainings for operators on equipment procured. This has caused the following issues: WISN orders from multiple contracts, causing us to pay multiple fees based on different quantity/ costs. This process creates a heavy administrative burden for the SPO Procuring in this way makes it very hard to have control and track procurements Our customers receive equipment piece by piece and do not receive a full operable kit at one time when we procure items Contract awards take too long and WISN has no control over when they award Requirements: For each item, please provide a narrative for how each interested party can meet each element. Past performance information, exercise participation, are acceptable. KSAs Experience working with the AFSPECWAR Community Experience in compliance with cybersecurity guidance (see attached Cyber document for examples) in accordance with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process. Access to Communications Security (COMSEC) material and compliance with AFMAN 17-1302, COMSEC Operations Procurement KPPs T=O Procure pieces of Type-1 encrypted equipment T=O Procure tactical communications equipment Examples of radio equipment: AC/PRC-117G, AN/PRC-160, AN/PRC-161, AC/PRC-163, AC/PRC-167, Trellisware products, ancillary pieces of hardware to support all radios Examples of networking equipment: Modems, routers, StarShield, encryptors (i.e. KG-250XS), Procure force protection equipment Emerging equipment: Able to procure emerging equipment as it is released for production T=O Store, assemble and ship kits procured through to CONUS and OCONUS locations Training KPPs T=O Provide training on all equipment procured T=O Contractor shall ensure that all instructors possess appropriate security clearances for the operation of AFSPECWAR systems and instructor lessons T=O Contractor must have a DD-254 to maintain the appropriate access level (TS/SCI) T=O Authorized to receive Government-furnished cryptographic equipment T=O Authorized to have email access to both SIPRNET and JWICS T=O Authorized to have administrative rights to SIPRNET stacks T=O Should have experience in managing, developing, distributing, publishing, maintaining, and making corrections to and updating courseware (format, grammar, spelling, and content) including courseware, baselines, syllabi, and training materials Instructions to Potential Respondents: Interested parties can submit a capabilities package (including developmental and production ready system) Ensure responses are structured and clearly labeled in the same order as outlined in the above-mentioned key requirements.

To clear the backlog, NIST is implementing a streamline quick process that will enable closeout of the files for those awards in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The backlog reflected in the attached spread sheet represents awards with $0 to $300 balances. The balance represents a significant burden to legacy acquisition and financial systems, but also impedes NIST’s efforts to appropriately archive expired awards and to prepare for transition and migration to modernized financial and procurement systems. By using the process described in this notice, NIST hopes to significantly reduce the backlog of expired awards and enable NIST to expeditiously complete closeout of the associated files. To facilitate the closeout of the awards identified in the attached spreadsheet, this notice serves as a Release of Liability of the Government; a copy of this notice will be in the contract files to reflect the release of liability. NIST is not aware of any known outstanding invoices for these awards. If you have any questions, regarding this notice, please forward to Biji John at Biji.John@nist.gov. Notwithstanding NIST’s intention to expeditiously closeout the award files for the actions identified in the attached spreadsheet, contractor rights are protected under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71 Contract Disputes (commonly known as the Contract Disputes Act of 1978), which establishes procedures for filing claims against Federal Government contracts. Normal FAR Subpart 4.8 contract file retention requirements will apply after the awards are closed."

The IUID definition at DFARS 211.274-1 says IUID ""is a system of marking, valuing and tracking items delivered to DoD."" These spares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered to DoD. The assets are delivered to a domestic U.S. freight forwarder who is under contract by the FMS customer to ship the assets to the country of record. The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assets to be specially marked for tracking by DoD. \"

Drawings are not available for this Request For Quote. Can only be procured only from suppliers who provide FAA-Certified parts which possess a FAA Authorized Release Certificate, FAA Form 8130-3 Airworthy Approval Tag. Offerors are advised that offers received from sources which are not government-approved sources of supply will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore ineligible for award. Any distributors of approved sources MUST submit a copy of their authorized distributor letter, on the source letterhead, to the buyer point of contact indicated on the solicitation via email, at time of proposal submittal. NAVSUP WSS Code N2 has determined that the requirements at DFARS 211.274 which mandates the use of DFARS clause 252.211-7003 ""Item Unique Identification and Valuation"" in all solicitations and contracts, be deleted from all non-CLSSA FMS spares requirements processed by NAVSUP WSS and DLA-Aviation. The affected parts are wholly owned by FMS customer countries, are not covered by a Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Arrangement (CLSSA), these same assets will be delivered to the customer country for their sole use. The IUID definition at DFARS 211.274-1 says IUID ""is a system of marking, valuing and tracking items delivered to DoD."" These spares are non-CLSSA FMS assets and will never be delivered to DoD. The assets are delivered to a domestic U.S. freight forwarder who is under contract by the FMS customer to ship the assets to the country of record. The FMS customer countries retain ownership of their parts throughout the asset's lifecycle. These parts will never be owned by the U.S. Government, and will never be entered into the DoD supply chain. Based on this, there is no need for these non-CLSSA FMS country assets to be specially marked for tracking by DoD. \"

Abatement/containment will take priority. Containment not to be removed once in place. Abatement procedures to be followed.

The email file size shall not exceed 10 MB. 3. General Requirements The NTP system will have the following major characteristics: Intuitive, stable and easy to use user interface for the system, designed to optimize Radiologist and PACS Assistant productivity and quality. System should be designed with a focus on human factors to optimize efficiency, while minimizing viewer fatigue and the incidence of repetitive motion injuries. The Contractor shall design, deploy, and support the system to handle receiving all VHA Radiology HL7 messages, covering 12 to 15 million annual exams. Of those, up to 2 million exams/studies will be read by the NTP team. The additional HL7 messages are used for patient history. Full activation to be completed no later than September 1, 2025. Phase 2/Optional Task 1 shall include expansion of up to 7 VISNs and up to 9 million annual exams total will be read within the NTP NextGen PACS (combined NTP and VISNs). 50-100 million reports are available in the NTP legacy PACS system. Product must be capable of either importing the legacy studies for the patient jacket or receiving the historical studies using just in time delivery via HL7. System must be optimized for WAN use. System shall have an integrated Radiologist worklist with study locking across the application in less than 0.5 seconds to prevent duplicate reading. NTP shall have a distinct worklist with designated assignment engine/workflow tools, while VISN PACS shall have the option to set up unique VISN-based or site-based worklists for their use. System provides an integrated tool for instant messaging (IM) communication within the system between radiologists and/or support staff with the ability to send embedded study links in the messages. IM tool will have the ability to broadcast messages to online users with individual and group responses. Upon receipt of a preliminary or final HL7v2 encoded report generated by a VA customer site, the study shall automatically be removed from the NTP unread worklist and the system shall prevent NTP interpretation of the study. For sites using NextGen PACS, their worklist shall include a designation that the study was assigned to NTP, but the HL7 message shall still be broadcast to VistA or Cerner for study tracking purposes. Integrated ACR compliant peer review functionality with on demand and assigned workflows. Peer review will incorporate separate workflow and scoring methodologies for internal NTP peer reviews and separately focused/ongoing peer reviews that NTP performs for VA customer facilities. Worklist options to include community/shared worklist, subspecialty group worklist, and user specific worklist assigned via assignment engine. TECHNICAL SUPPORT Vendor must provide 24x7x365 technical support via the prime vendor help desk with off-hours escalation to senior level support within 15 minutes of initial call. Vendor must provide an ongoing commitment to NTP for continuous product development and enhancement to ensure that the system remains on the most current version deployed. Application updates must not require elevated privileges to install on client workstations. Vendor must agree to comply with all applicable VA security requirements, to include DISA STIGS Vendor will be responsible for all OS patching, AV updates and application updates/upgrades to meet VA security requirements. Windows OS patches are available via an internal WSUS repository. Linux servers must also be patched and can be managed through the VA RHEL satellite server provided the Linux servers meet the VA baseline. If Linux based and not utilizng the VA baseline of RedHat 8 or 9, vendor will be responsible for managing updates independent of the VA satellite server. Software maintenance for application and associated components to include updates and upgrades and all requisite security maintenance to remain in compliance with NIST, FISMA, and VA security standards will be provided and installed by the vendor. The maintenance window for software updates will be limited to 15 minutes of downtime Tuesday-Thursday mornings unless otherwise specified by the VA. Maintenance updates/upgrades requiring longer than 15 minutes will be addressed on a case-by-case basis but should not exceed 60 minutes. ARCHITECTURE AND SECURITY The NTP system is a mission critical application that is required to be online 24x7x365. The system shall be designed and deployed with appropriate redundancy and fault tolerance to eliminate single points of failure. The target uptime threshold for the overall system must be 99.99%. The Contractor s design and technical support infrastructure must meet or exceed that level of performance. System shall be designed for 99.99% uptime as measured by 24x7 availability with performance penalties applied when uptime falls below 99.9% as calculated monthly. Downtime will be defined as failure of one or more components that measurably impacts VA s ability to receive or interpret studies or transmit reports to the originating EMR. Contractor shall provide NTP and VISNs with a monthly uptime report with adjusted billing of the ongoing service/support cost per the discount rate below. Note that scheduled downtime such as work to complete software upgrades and maintenance is excluded from the downtime calculation. Fail-over and/or test servers shall be used to perform these activities with little or no impact to the clinical operations. Microsoft SQL requirements must support multi-subnet SQL AG configurations. System shall be deployed with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 or successor compliant encryption of sensitive data at rest. System will be designed to optimally utilize bandwidth across the VA WAN and to/from the cloud-based components. The system has three possible deployment methods. First, virtual machines within the VA subscription of the Azure GOVCLOUD Virginia using Availability Zone 1 and 2 for redundancy. Second, a private cloud deployment within the VA Azure GOVCLOUD Virginia subscription that supports multiple AZs for failover. Third, SaaS with a current FedRAMP authorization for high impact. For the private cloud deployment within the VA Azure GOVCLOUD Virginia scenario all Azure Native services must be approved by the VA for use. The availability of Azure Native services in GOVCLOUD does not mean it has been approved by the VA. All system components will be covered under NTP s NextGen PACS Authority to Operate (ATO) and vendor must meet all of the design, development, documentation and sustainment requirements of the ATO for initial deployment and on an ongoing basis. Annual order/report capacity should be sized for 20M studies combined across both EMRs. Contractor shall provide database access to NTP's analytics application, Foundations by Health Level Inc., such that data can be extracted from the system to Foundations. Additionally, the system shall provide workflow status messages to Foundations via HL7 messages for tracking and analytics report creation. Sample workflow status messages include but are not limited to, image receipt, QA approved to dictate, study opened, report started, final report signed, etc. System will utilize normalized VistA generated accession numbers to the following format: ###-MMDDYY-123 where ### is the 3-digit site code for the originating VistA instance and similarly all studies and reports that utilize SSN as the primary identifier will have their data normalized to the dashed format 000-00-0000. For sites that utilize Cerner as their EMR, the system will be able to uniquely identify the patient via both the EDIPI and SSN and will utilize an MPI. The VA has four possible patient identifiers, EDIPI, SSN, ICN, and DFN (Vista only). System must support multiple patient identifiers. All reports within the NextGen PACS system, both NTP generated and those that are created at local sites, will be viewable within the patient jacket of the worklist. Contractor shall provide a fully operational test instance of the system with all components. This shall be used for Cerner interface testing, application upgrade testing and potentially as a backup in case of either catastrophic failure and/or serious cybersecurity events. The system shall be capable of simulating at least 10% load of current production. Deployment with final validation to be completed no later than September 1, 2025. Post NTP deployment, VISNs may elect to exercise optional line items on the IDIQ to utilize the system with a separate organizational structure. For VISN options, vendor will also handle report migration and will provide 5 years on-site data storage at a central VISN location if required for application performance. System shall interface with existing NTP STAT web portal. STAT and Critical cases sent to NTP have 2 separate submission components: DICOM export of case to be read along with relevant priors and an accompanying web portal submission. The web portal submission is used by the Techs at the site to notify NTP that a case has been sent and it provides contact information if a callback is required, image count, exam notes, etc. The existing web portal sends PACS an HL7 message with the submitted information. That data shall be incorporated into PACS for pre-read QC and Radiologist viewing. The STAT portal HL7 messages do not include the PID segment. Vendor must support adding the STAT portal data based on accession number and only update the HL7 data provided by the STAT portal and not erase other HL7 fields not provided by the STAT portal HL7 message. System shall be designed and deployed such that it is installed on Medical Device Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and behind Access Control Lists (ACLs) or firewalls. For all contractor deployed components, all unused services shall be disabled. The systems shall be hardened to the greatest extent possible without impacting clinical performance or utility. All HL7 traffic shall utilize resilient links that shall auto-restart with message/data failure/rejection/time-out and the system shall include a notification mechanism to the contractor and NTP support when failure is detected. HL7 interfaces shall support TLS 1.2 or its successor for connection to VA Data Access Services (DAS) (VA's centralized HL7 broker and gateway) and Rhapsody CorePoint. The system shall support HL7 ADT, ORM and ORU messages from all VA EMRs. System shall be designed to optimally utilize bandwidth across the Wide Area Network (WAN) and to/from the cloud-based components. At a minimum, the system shall log transactions in an audit trail at the following time points: user logon/logoff, receipt of images by PACS, each instance of a study being opened and who viewed and closed that study, on which workstation it was viewed (including if it was opened from the EMR), start of reporting, signature of report, successful upload of report, deletion of study and/or report, and any change to demographic or study information. Logs shall be maintained while the study is on the system. If a study is deleted and subsequently repulled, the original audit trail shall be reinstated. The audit trail shall be kept for no less than three years and all messages shall be synced with an internal VA time server. Transmission of any data outside of the VA network shall be via a VA approved VPN solution and is allowed only with FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption. Sensitive patient information shall not be stored outside of VA organizational control for purposes other than for short term troubleshooting purposes. After the requirement for the data has been satisfied, the data shall be securely erased. Workstations and servers shall run anti-virus software and accept automated patching. Non-diagnostic workstations for Tech and PACS Admin access shall utilize the standard VA baseline PC image and shall operate with the full suite of VA security controls. All applications, web-apps and associated components required for non-diagnostic support, workflow, management, administration, and operation shall be required to be fully functional on a VA baseline image PC. Web-based applications for diagnostic and non-diagnostic workstations shall be fully functional with VA baseline versions of Edge and Chrome browsers and accept the VA browser security settings. System shall operate without external Internet access per VA Medical Device Protection Program guidelines (exclusive of VPN connectivity). The database shall be dedicated solely to the system and comingling storage of VA PHI data with any non-federal data is not permitted. SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION The selection of a critical results diagnostic code by a Radiologist shall automatically initiate a support request via the communication tool and Support worklist to initiate a callback to the referring provider. INTEGRATION System shall interface with the VA s Master Person Index (MPI), which is the primary system for assigning and maintaining unique person identifiers and provides enterprise-wide identity management. The NTP Rhapsody system will query the VA MPI and provide the EDIPI and ICN patient identifiers. The Worklist software must be able to accept MPI maintenance messages to correct any patient ICN identifier misconfigurations that MPI identifies and report the status of the correction. System shall support multiple identifiers for each patient via internal Master Patient Index (MPI) functionality internal to the system. System must be able to seamlessly function with both VistA and Cerner EMR interfaces and be able to utilize the appropriate primary patient identifier for each respective system to uniquely identify patients and ensure a patient s data appears as a singular instance within the system. Seamless HL7 integration with NTP NextGen PACS Rhapsody CorePoint HL7 Engine. Seamless integration with NTP NextGen PACS voice recognition system (Nuance PowerScribe One 2019). Seamless integration with NTP NextGen PACS Mach7 eUnity Viewer. Seamless integration with NTP NextGen PACS Blackford AI suite of applications for Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) identification, large vessel occlusion (LVO) breast density and breast cancer/nodule detection. AI results will be incorporated into study prioritization. The system shall provide seamless integration with VA/DoD Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV), which requires the use of Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW). This shall include a button to launch JLV directly from within the PACS application, have it pass patient context via CCOW to JLV, and then maintain patient context as different studies are viewed within the PACS (i.e. update CCOW context). System must support application authentication using Single Sign-On (SSO). Options for SSO include VA Active Directory and Azure Entra ID. CLIENT VIEWER The system shall be designed to accommodate 4 different categories/priorities: CRIT, STAT, ASAP/Inpatient, and Routine, with distinct turn-around times (TATs) for each level. The worklist shall display the time remaining before expiration of TAT for each unread exam and TAT shall be calculated from the time, new, unread images are received and available for NTP interpretation. The system in conjunction with the PACS diagnostic viewer and associated voice recognition window shall fully launch and be ready for review/dictation within 3 seconds after study selection from the worklist or activation of the Next Study function. Performance target shall be met for users working within a VA site and home users working via VPN at 10 Mb/s minimum throughput. The Radiologist viewing client shall run on VA-provided hardware with Windows 10 LTSC or Windows 10 Enterprise operating system or Windows 11. Workstations shall support VA approved anti-virus software (currently Windows Defender but may change with subsequent VA-wide AV award). AV shall be deployed with contractor provided file or folder exclusions. PACS workstations shall permit automated Windows patching. Any software running on the Radiologist desktop must be able to be updated without requiring administrative privileges on the desktop. A pop-up indicating a client update that the Radiologist can run as a user, not administrator, on the desktop is acceptable. End user applications shall be made compatible with any new Windows major versions within 24 months of its commercial release. The system shall be a cloud-native design with dynamic streaming as a fundamental design feature. The system shall be fast, intuitive, stable, easy to use, and designed to optimize productivity and quality and reduce repetitive motion injuries. Data cached/stored on the workstation shall be deleted from the system at the close of the study or application. System shall include a real-time productivity tracking tool visible for each respective Radiologist within their PACS worklist. The tool shall be configurable to display daily wRVU or adjusted wRVU (NTP specific wRVU values per CPT code and LOINC codes for Cerner sites). System shall include an integrated collaboration tool for communication within the system between Radiologists and/or support staff with the ability to send embedded study links in the messages. Collaboration tool shall have the ability to broadcast messages to online users with individual and group responses and shall incorporate logging as well. The system shall provide the ability for Radiologists to jointly confer on a study in real time while they view it. The system shall provide visual cues on the worklist that indicate a study is approaching expiration of the assigned turn-around-time within the 4 priorities (CRIT, STAT, ASAP, and Routine). The system shall provide a separate visual cue on the worklist to indicate a study is overdue from the assigned turn-around-time within the 4 priorities (CRIT, STAT, ASAP, and Routine). The Radiologist shall be notified if another user is viewing the same exam on another workstation and shall be prevented from creating a duplicate report. The system shall immediately notify the Radiologist if a local report for a study they are viewing has been received. This can occur when a site disregards the stub message or initiates dictation before the NTP stub report is filed. The system shall also immediately notify the Radiologist if additional images are received on a case they are currently dictating. Worklist shall allow manual reassignment of studies to another radiologist, indicate what studies have been reported, and whether the report has uploaded to the EMR successfully. Manual reassignments shall be a logged event as this process needs to be highly monitored. Patient history and reason for study shall be mapped from the HL7 message and shall be available for review within the worklist. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Positive AI findings shall trigger a change to a higher priority status in the system. Negative findings shall not decrement the submitted priority level. WORKFLOW TOOLS The system shall include a closed-loop support request tool between Support and the Radiologists to facilitate assistance requests and critical results. The Support tool shall provide a mechanism for Support to claim a request, so multiple individuals do not work on the same problem and the requestor knows who has the assignment. The Support tool shall track issues from initiation to resolution with time stamps along each step and export of data to Foundations for tracking. System shall include an internal collaboration tool. User list shall default to online users within the logged in user s organization (NTP, VISN X or site Y) but shall permit cross org communication via org drop down selection. System shall immediately assign critical exams (stroke and intraoperative radiograph) to a qualified Radiologist once processed by Support and shall be treated as the highest priority. Once cleared to read, the assigned Radiologist shall receive an automated notification within their worklist or viewing window alerting them that they have a case that needs immediate interpretation. Upon receipt of a STAT or CRIT web portal request, the system shall automatically upgrade the priority of the case within the system to the same status regardless of the HL7 ORM priority value and the escalated priority shall remain locked unless manually changed by Support. Subsequent HL7 messages cannot downgrade only upgrade the priority. The system shall incorporate a post-assignment problem list to track cases that the Radiologists identify which need to be addressed by Support prior to sign off. Worklist shall function similar to the pre-read QC list where Support will claim the case and will address the issue until resolved. The post-assignment problem list shall also incorporate workflow for critical callbacks where the Radiologist is notifying Support that a critical callback is required. Integrated American College of Radiology (ACR) compliant peer review functionality with on demand and assigned workflows shall be provided. Peer review shall incorporate separate workflow and scoring methodologies for internal NTP peer reviews, peer learning and peer reviews that NTP performs for VA customer facilities. Note the system shall include similar peer review capabilities for the VISN system, however the external review functionality is typically used by NTP. The specific scoring criteria that is used for each type of review (NTP internal versus VHA-site focused review) shall be specific for each org, e.g. NTP peer reviews will have RadPeer scoring as the displayed option while a review for site A would have met/not met criteria listed and site B review would display RadPeer. ASSIGNMENT ENGINE & WORKLIST The system shall include an assignment engine (AE) that is fully integrated with the PACS worklist. The AE design shall be designed to minimize report turn-around time while maximizing subspecialty interpretations. AE shall support no less than 12 distinct subspecialty designations for STAT and CRIT workflow and no less than 12 designations that are applicable for Routine and ASAP priority cases. AE shall utilize a combination of CPT codes, LOINC codes (for Cerner sites), study descriptions, and priorities to identify the subspecialty group(s) for each case to be interpreted. AE shall assign a fixed number of CRIT/STAT and ASAP/Routine cases to each logged in Radiologist. The system shall also support assignment of a fixed wRVU amount to each active Radiologist. System shall have a default setting of Auto Next to automatically open the next case on the Radiologist s worklist along with associated report template. Disabling Auto Next shall be an elevated system privilege. System shall incorporate a Skip function that shall allow a Radiologist to move to the next case and temporarily bypass Auto Next. If Skip is invoked, it shall require a comment from the Radiologist and it shall be an auditable/logged event. NTP and VISNs shall operate on unique instances of the AE so that NTP workflow shall not dictate subspecialty assignment for other VISNs who use the NextGen PACS. In other words, each Org, (NTP, VISN1, VISN2, site X) shall have their own worklist and AE setup and an administrative tool to manage AE configuration. AE shall continually update system status in the background and within 1 second of report signoff, it shall have the next available case assigned to any Radiologist. AE shall be configurable by PACS Administrators via GUI to change assignment parameters, subspecialty groups and subspecialty mapping. Multipart exams such as CT chest plus abdomen/pelvis shall be managed as separate exams if sent to the PACS with distinct image sets and shall be evaluated by the AE accordingly. System shall support the use of a fixed set of mandatory worklists or worklist filters that shall be the default configuration within the system.

MHS GENESIS was implemented as the first all-in-one record electronic health record (EHR) system for the entire Department of Defense. The MHS GENESIS solution is also used by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the Reserve Components (RCs), the United States Military Entrance Processing Command (US MEPCOM), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) with deployment to the National Security Agency (NSA) in progress. MHS GENESIS plays a vital role in ensuring health, increasing readiness, and improving the safety of care. By standardizing clinical and business processes, MHS GENESIS enables beneficiaries to fully engage in their health care, and focuses on quality, safety, and patient outcomes that will ensure the Military Health System (MHS) can provide high-quality and reliable care globally. MHS GENESIS is comprised of inpatient and outpatient software solutions from Oracle Health (formerly Cerner), a dental solution from Henry Schein, an enterprise service bus, a suite of revenue cycle management capabilities, and interfaces to external systems that enhance capability delivery. MHS GENESIS is supported by uniquely configured and integrated third-party clinical content, functional baseline content (such as workflows, roles, training, and reports), local site “builds” (including formularies, device locations, and clinic information), solution-unique hardware, infrastructure, clinical application services, and turn-key operational management services in a contractor-provided “enclave.” The core of MHS GENESIS is interfaced with additional commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, including virtual and behavioral health capabilities from Converge, Conversa, and Silvercloud, virtual health delivery from Phillips eCare, and population health management and analytics from HealtheIntent. MHS GENESIS provides patients with a single record of care. It integrates inpatient, outpatient, and dental records, and improves communication between patients, military hospitals and clinics, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and civilian health providers. Patients utilize a portal for seamless, secure messaging with providers and access to their medical history. MHS GENESIS is a system of systems, meaning that it contains interfaced EHR COTS product components from multiple different sources (e.g., Oracle Health, Henry Schein, etc.). MHS GENESIS has an enormous scale and level of complexity. The solution is comprised of 12 major subsystems, utilizes 81 DOD, joint, or commercial interfaces across more than 1,000 end points, and processes at least 20 million messages daily. MHS GENESIS has more than 975 workflows and more than 200 user roles, and it serves 194,000 users and 9.6 million beneficiaries across 137 commands globally. MHS GENESIS contains 255 TB of Millenium data growing at 100 TB annually. The DOD spent 7 years, 2017-2024, migrating data from legacy sites into MHS GENESIS. Additional data is stored across MHS GENESIS’s 12 major subsystem footprints. MHS GENESIS is comprised of ~26,000 hardware and software assets to deliver capabilities which need to be scanned every 48 hours for cyber vulnerabilities (and remediated as necessary). During deployment, each of the 26 waves averaged more than 7,500 end points. The MHS GENESIS system documentation is lacking with respect to the sustainment processes and procedures and internal interface configurations. Other technical documentation, such as architecture artifacts and system/sub-system design documents, are understandable to the current prime contractor and Government team but need to be revised so they are understandable to a third party. This would include documenting how the system is configured, and how the system is maintained and operated, and who is responsible for various functions. Because MHS GENESIS is in the process of migrating to the cloud, the documentation would need to be developed during the migration, completed within approximately six months after the cloud migration is complete, and the process would require cooperation with the current prime contractor. The final documentation deliverables should provide offerors with sufficient information to competitively respond to a full and open competition to support MHS GENESIS, including systems integration, hosting, and software licensing. The Government is seeking industry feedback to address the following: What is the best approach to creating and maintaining consistent and comprehensive documentation in an environment such as that of MHS GENESIS where there are multiple vendors (for example, multiple COTS product component vendors)? What, if any, risks or lessons learned should be taken into account when creating and maintaining system documentation in an environment such as MHS GENESIS? Where should lines of responsibility by drawn between software component vendors responsible for delivery as opposed to software component vendors responsible for documentation? With respect to coordinating the drafting of documentation? With respect to consolidating documentation? Any recommended incentive(s) or disincentive(s) to promote a cohesive and cooperative working relationship between and among a contractor engaged to develop documentation, the MHS GENESIS prime contractor, and the COTS product component vendors? What are important Service Level Agreement (SLA) measurements and key outcomes the Government should consider for the documentation services? How would you recommend measuring success for each recommended SLA and key outcome? How can innovation be used to support the creation and maintenance of technical documentation to support MHS GENESIS? Small Business Set Aside Is this a capability that Small Business or 8(a) could support as a set aside? Provide a reasoning for your response. Please advise what NAICS code and reasoning in accordance with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting. Please also identify whether you qualify under such NAICS code as a small business or 8(a).

This procurement is being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 12.301(c) procedures. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers quote, conforming to the solicitation, whose quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, and whose quoted price is found to be reasonable. Price alone is not the sole evaluation factor. In addition to the general standards of responsibility found at FAR 9.104-1, in accordance with FAR 9.104-2, the special standards of responsibility described below apply to this procurement. Offerors who fail to meet any special standard of responsibility will not be eligible to receive contract award. General Standards of Responsibility To assist the contracting officer in determining if the general standards of responsibility applicable to this procurement are met, offerors shall provide a narrative with their quotes confirming that they understand/ If the offeror s proposal intends to utilize subcontractor(s), then the narrative must include a breakdown of what portions will be completed by the offeror and their proposed subcontractor(s). Failure to include this information could result in a contracting officer s determination that an otherwise successful offeror is not eligible for contract award. Special Standards of Responsibility (SSR) To assist the contracting officer in determining if the special standards of responsibility applicable to this procurement are met, offerors are asked to provide the following information with their quotes. Failure to include this information could result in a contracting officer s determination that an otherwise successful offeror is not eligible for contract award. SP1 Contractor s Specialized Experience. Offeror shall provide copies of three (3) different past performance evaluations (preferably Federal Government evaluations) with points of contacts as reference for similar online digital subscription services performed within the past 2 years within the range of 2020 present. SP2 Contractor Certification. Offeror shall provide documentation from Schneider Electric which verifies that Contractor is an authorized service provider for Schneider Electric brands. and that Contractor s technicians have received factory training from Schneider Electric. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) Evaluation Process. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner. The lowest-priced quote will be identified. The lowest-priced quote will be evaluated to determine if the quoted price exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement. If the quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, the quoted price will be evaluated to determine if it is reasonable. If the quoted price is found to be reasonable, the contracting officer will then determine if the offeror is responsible using the general standards of responsibility and the special standards of responsibilities (SSRs) applicable to this procurement. If contract award cannot be made to the offeror, the contracting officer will evaluate the next lowest-priced quote following the procedures described above. This process will continue until a contract award can be made, or the contracting officer determines that no contract award can be made. The contracting officer may likewise find all quotes, not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the quotes under evaluation exceeds the amount of funding available and/or technical documents do not meet the SOW and SSRs for the procurement. Technical documents and past performance, when combined, are more important than price, in accordance with FAR 15.304, the relative importance of all other evaluation factors. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and technical documents to award a contract without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions at any time if determined by the contracting officer to be in the Government s interest. (End of Provision) Vendor Questions Note: Some vendor questions are similar that are slightly rephrased differently than other vendor questions, but the questions and the answers are the same. Who is the incumbent? Answer: There is currently no incumbent as this is a new requirement. What was the previous/current contract# for this requirement? Answer: Currently there is no active or recent service contract for this requirement. What is the budget for this requirement? Answer: The VA does not disclose the funding/budgeted amount for the requirement since this is an open market competitive solicitation. Therefore, we highly recommend for vendors to provide their best offer that they believe is competitive. Regarding the APC Symmetra PX 40.0 kVA, serial #EDO437001086 and the Toshiba 4200 FA CT 20kVA, serial #4000914UE09400, what is the battery count / battery type / brand? Answer: APC Symmetra - There are 128 batteries (APC Replacement Battery Cartridge, Valve regulated lead acid battery, 7Ah, 12VDC). All 128 batteries, and 4 fans were replaced in March 2024. There are currently no known alarms. Toshiba There are 30 batteries (50505EN, 12VDC, 506W). It states in the Solicitation that the vendor must be an Authorized Service Provider (ASP) of Schneider Electric. We are not aware of Schneider authorizing third parties to perform these services. Can you confirm? Answer: Documentation provided to this office by Schneider Electric states that they do utilize ASPs. Several of the battery units have recently been replaced, therefore it is important that the vendor is fully authorized so that any remaining factory warranty remains intact. In relation to this however, it has been determined that the requirement for the technicians to have received Schneider factory training to be redundant to the requirement to be an ASP, therefore the factory training requirement is removed from the Special Standards of Responsibility listed in FAR 52.212-2."

The NAICS code for the work described below is 238320. The project will be unrestricted. The period of performance will be approximately 545 days. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 - $20,000,000. The Vertical Lift Railroad Bridge carries an active railroad track across the Cape Cod Canal Navigation Channel in the vicinity of Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts. The bridge, constructed in 1935 under the direction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, is a three-span bridge with one main moveable lift span which is flanked by a tower (257-foot tall) and approach span at each end. All spans are composed of bolted and riveted steel through trusses. The main lift span is 544 feet long and when in the raised position provides a vertical clearance of 136 feet above mean high water to accommodate vessel traffic below the bridge. The approach spans are 128 feet long.The scope of this project shall include blast cleaning all the metalwork of the bridge down to bare metal and application of a high-performance paint system. The preparation methods will likely include solvent cleaning (SSPC SP 1) to remove all visible oil, grease, and other contaminant residues followed by commercial blast cleaning (SSPC SP 6/NACE No.3). The paint system to be applied is anticipated to be a three-coat system. Potential bidders may refer to EM-385-1-1 for requirements related to abrasive blasting, air monitoring and full containment on USACE projects. In addition to the painting, there will be a limited number of steel repairs required on the structure at the towers and center span. The bridge will need to be properly balanced at all times. All use of tools or equipment that may affect the balance of the span will require the Contractor to furnish and install balance blocks on the Bridge counterweights.During the project, the navigation channel below the moveable span of the bridge will remain open. Additionally, the Railroad Bridge is required to remain functional to accommodate scheduled trains daily. The Mass Coastal Railroad utilizes the bridge to haul waste from Cape Cod typically six days a week. The State provides passenger rail service on weekends during the summer months. The passenger train typically requires the vertical lift bridge to operate six times per week from June to September. Potential bidders shall note that there will be significant coordination requirements with MBTA, the Mass Coastal Railroad as well as the Cape Cod Canal Marine Traffic Controller to successfully sequence the work of this project."

Onboarding is a result of the provisions established in the original solicitation and is issued as a solicitation amendment to the original solicitation. The terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that 'The award decision under the open season solicitation is based upon the same evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation.' Additionally, the terms and conditions of the original solicitation require that, 'The terms and conditions of any resulting new IBPA awards are identical to the original awards and solicitation, to include period of performance.' Accordingly, while the Government will entertain suggestions and Industry input regarding the Onboarding amendment, the Government anticipates very little change to result from this input, especially as it regards any potential changes to the evaluation factors or resulting terms and conditions. This amendment for Onboarding is against a Multiple Award Incident Blanket Purchase Agreement (IBPA) solicitation issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The open season Onboarding period will coincide with the USFS Contracting Officer (CO) IBPA Annual Review process, traditionally referred to as a 'Rollover' Modification process for existing IBPA awardees. Existing IBPA awardees will have the same opportunity to revise, modify rates, and add resources the same as potential new contractors do. All proposed resources are subject to the original solicitation criteria. New Offerors that meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the original solicitation may submit a quote response through the VIPR system during open season. Award decisions from an open season solicitation response are based upon the same evaluation factors/sub-factors as the original solicitation. New quote responses must meet all Acceptability Pass/Fail Criteria of the original solicitation. The terms and conditions of any resulting new IBPA awards are identical to the original awards and solicitation, to include period of performance. Immediately after Onboarding and at the conclusion of the CO annual review/rollover modification period, any additional Contractors or accepted new resources to existing agreements are eligible to receive dispatches/BPA Calls with the same ordering procedures as listed within the agreements."

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. 6.2 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F.

Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) portfolio of research and development (R&D) efforts in the past has included projects to characterize and model the above-mentioned phenomena so the industry can design effectively. The R&D community in general has hit the knowledge/validation data barrier that the lack of above-mentioned data represents. Consequently, WETO has mobilized funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Base Appropriations to support a fundamental R&D effort to overcome these barriers. NREL will lead/manage “Aerodynamics of Large Turbines” (ALTius) resulting from this RFP with the following goals: • Collect and disseminate benchmark airfoil aerodynamic data to validate and improve the tools/models that assure the performance of next-generation wind turbine blades. • Provide data to validate modeling and simulation tools to predict the behavior of nonoperational wind turbine rotors, e.g., when they are stopped for installation, maintenance, or idling (during the passage of extreme weather). • Inform the wind industry with physical insights that advance modeling capabilities to minimize the risks and costs of next-generation wind turbines. The RFP is organized by objectives into two (2) different topic areas of interest."

For those interested in access, please submit the signed Terms of Use Agreement, DD 2345, and a capabilities statment, if those have not already been provided as well as a request for Bidder's Library access via e-mail to Brittany Burton, (brittany.m.burton4.civ@us.navy.mil), and Tom Kostyo (thomas.f.kostyo.civ@us.navy.mil), with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Holly Danner (holly.r.danner.civ@us.navy.mil). SECTION 1: SYNOPSIS The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems Above Water Sensors and Lasers directorate (PEO IWS 2.0). NAVSEA is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for the AN/SPY-6 radar variants. This includes the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) (AN/SPY-6(V)1) for DDG-51 FLT III, the AMDR Backfit radar for DDG-51 FLT IIA (AN/SPY-6(V)4), the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) Rotator (AN/SPY-6(V)2), and the EASR Fixed Face (AN/SPY-6(V)3). For convenience, the term “SPY-6” is used in this RFI to refer to all noted radar variants. The SPY-6 variant radars are built upon common hardware line replaceable units (LRUs) using modular, open system principles. The basis for production of SPY-6 hardware is contained in the Technical Data Package (TDP), which will be provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI). It is PEO IWS 2.0’s intent to procure “Build-to-Print” (BTP) SPY-6 hardware under a new competitively awarded contract(s) in FY26. The term Build-to-Print in this context means producing to the exact specifications, drawings, and design contained within the TDP, with modifications allowed only for the purposes of addressing obsolescence, non-compliances with the system specifications (A-Specifications), and reducing life-cycle cost of all SPY-6 radars to be fielded. Software development, software and system integration and test, and software maintenance will be separately competed and are not intended as a topic of this RFI. The Government is evaluating procurement strategies, including winner-take-all, “Leader-Challenger”, and/or GFE breakouts of LRUs or subsystems as a separate contract(s). Feedback is desired from industry on these different strategies. Contract types may be fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed price, or some combination thereof, to be determined. SECTION 2: GENERAL INFORMATION Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3 this is a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This RFI is for planning purposes and is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind by the Government. Specific responses will not disqualify or have an impact on participation and evaluation on future solicitations. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) website and interested parties must comply with that announcement. It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor SAM for additional information pertaining to this requirement. Any small businesses that believe they can accomplish this entire requirement should indicate their small business status (see FAR Part 19) in their response. PEO IWS 2.0 representatives may or may not choose to meet with RFI respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements. Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer’s email addresses. Verbal questions will not be accepted. Questions shall not contain classified information. SECTION 3: REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW A brief overview of the SPY-6 variant mission requirements and array configuration is provided as follows: AN/SPY-6(V)1 is designed to meet mission performance and size, weight, and power – cooling (SWAP-C) requirements of the DDG-51 FLT III ships with AEGIS Baseline 10 (BL 10) combat system. The AN/SPY-6(V)1 will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications in a wide diversity of environments and conditions. This variant includes 37 Radar Modular Assemblies (RMAs) per array, each which contain independent transmit and receive LRUs and provide SPY +16 minimum sensitivity. There are 4 arrays per shipset. AN/SPY-6(V)2 is designed to meet mission performance and SWAP-C requirements of the CVN(Nimitz) class carriers, Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) hulls, and Landing Platform/Dock (LPD) hulls.

If so, any lessons learned that the Government should incorporate into the contracting strategy? What manufacturing facilities does your organization have and what product lines have been developed in these facilities in the past? Do you see utility in the Government pursuing a strategy other than winner-take-all for award? The Government contemplates pursuing a “Leader-Challenger” strategy whereby the majority of units are awarded to the Leader and remainder of the units are awarded to the Challenger. Are there other strategies you suggest or specific parameters you would suggest to increase your interest in competing? If the Government pursues a “Leader-Challenger” strategy, would your organization primarily be interested in competing for the Leader role or the Challenger role? Why? What obstacles do you see to competing in either the Leader or Challenger role for SPY-6 production? Are there any subsystems or components of the system that you believe are opportunities for competition? What timeframes do you believe are appropriate for proposals, competition, and time from contract award to first production unit delivery? What minimum time does your organization require with the TDP prior to submitting a proposal? Do you have suggestions for ways to reduce system cost other than through competition? What upgrades does your organization already have planned for manufacturing facilities? How would preparing for this competition change those plans? How would being awarded a contract change those plans? What flexibility does your organization have in production processes to adjust/adapt to increasing/decreasing number of production units?

The FSS program is directed and managed by GSA and provides Federal agencies with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with volume buying. Indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contracts are awarded to provide supplies and services at stated prices for given periods of time. GSA has delegated authority to the VA to manage the Schedules for medical supplies under the VA FSS program. This solicitation is for the offering of reference laboratory services for the purpose of providing medical laboratory testing for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition and to assess patient health to make clinical decisions for patient care.Â This solicitation is not for facilities that only collect and/or prepare specimens nor for those facilities that only serve as a mailing service and do not perform testing services. This solicitation is issued to establish contracts which may be used on a nonmandatory basis by eligible users, as a source of supply for the supplies or services described herein, for domestic. Domestic delivery is defined as delivery within the 48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Washington, DC, and U.S. territories . Offerors may be limited to geographic service areas based upon licensing requirements or may offer nationwide delivery. This solicitation further requires that offered prices cover delivery to destinations (i.e. F.O.B. destination) located within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Offerors can choose whether or not prices cover delivery f.o.b. destination to Alaska, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Additionally, the solicitation defines the number of calendar days after receipt of order (ARO) within which delivery must be made. Offerors who cannot provide the required minimum geographic coverage, that is one state, will not be considered for award. As specified in the solicitation, offerors shall comply with all state, federal and local regulations, licenses, permits, and accreditation necessary to manage and conduct preanalytic specimen testing services. Offerors must comply with states that require out of state licenses/permits. Therefore, laboratories conducting clinical testing on specimens originating in a state that requires an out of state license/permit must hold that state s Department of Health (or other governing body) clinical laboratory permit, licenses, etc. Â Offerors that are not compliant with the originating state s licensing and/or permit requirement, regardless of location, will not be considered for an award for that specific state. Offerors may not subcontract to another laboratory to circumvent the originating state s requirement for licensing, permits, etc. The offeror, in itself, is required to meet the requirements of the solicitation without the aid of a subcontractor. The Government retains sole discretion to determine the offeror s capability, compliance, and to limit SINs or geographic coverage. Commercial Items Per GSA regulations at 538.271(a), MAS awards are for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101. Special Item Numbers (SINs): FSS solicitations set forth broad categories of accepted products/services, referred to as Special Item Numbers (SINs), listed in the Continuation of SF1449 in Vendor Response Document 02. Offerors are not required to submit their entire catalog of products/services but are free to choose which items they will offer as long as those items fall within one of the solicitation s pre-defined SIN categories. Items that do not fall within one of these SINs are considered to be out of scope of the solicitation and cannot be awarded. An item s acceptability under the schedule may be further restricted by a determination of fair and reasonable pricing. Offered diagnostic testing services must be categorized under the accepted services referenced under the Special Item Numbers (SINs) and classified as a specialties or subspecialties of tests as defined under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Please note that items offered are further restricted to those tests with CPT codes. Additionally, FSS will not award any home diagnostic tests under this schedule. Home diagnostic tests/test kits may be proposed under Schedule 65 V II Invitro Diagnostics, Reagents, Test Kits and Test Sets. FDA Regulatory Requirements Reagents used to perform the tests must be FDA cleared, as appropriate, or be identified as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT). Offerors of tests not in compliance with these requirements shall not be considered for award under this solicitation.

There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARKED WITH THE NOMENCLATURE AS CITED ON IRPOD.

DOCUMENT REF DATA=MIL-STD-129 | | |R |190927|A| |02| DOCUMENT REF DATA=ISO9001 | | | |010417|A| | | 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The CIRCUIT CARD ASSEMB furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;0VSS0 DCQ-1800-A; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the SPCC Contracting Officer has been notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize MIL-I-45208 if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

This process is repeated in order of price until an offer or combination of offers is deemed technically acceptable and price is determined fair and reasonable. Options. When applicable, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The Raymark Superfund Site includes areas that have been contaminated as a result of manufacturing processes from the former Raymark facility. Specifically, contaminated waste material was used as fill in various locations within the Town of Stratford, CT. The OU5 remediation requires the excavation and offsite disposal of approximately 10,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil (primarily PCBs, metals, and Asbestos) and site restoration. The OU5 property is in the vicinity of Shore Road and the Housatonic Boat Club. OU6 (Morgan Francis) property was a historically low-lying area that was filled with Raymark waste. The remediation for that property requires the excavation of approximately 5,000 cubic yards of waste from an adjacent creek, restoration, consolidation of that waste on the Morgan Francis Property, and construction of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste landfill cap and supporting infrastructure. The area of the Morgan Francis site to be capped is approximately 6 acres. The to-be-constructed RCRA cap will have an average thickness of 4 feet and will consist of a low permeability liner system with soil cover. The Site abuts a residential area of town and, as such, there are significant air monitoring, dust control, traffic management, and public safety requirements as part of this project. This project has the following major components: Remediation, including excavation, and restoration of OU5; Remediation, including excavation, and restoration of a section of creek adjacent to Morgan Francis; RCRA cap constructed per design and specifications; Supporting infrastructure, including but not limited to, storm-water basins, swales, gas vent system, utility corridors, access roads; Robust air monitoring and dust prevention practices."

Draft Vicinity Maps which include Phase 2 as well as Phases 1 and 3 pre-solicited separately have been provided as an attachment to this notice. All the roads to be treated via this contract are detailed on the maps. Period of Performance: The tentative date for completion of all Mandatory work is October 15, 2027. Optional work shall be completed by October 15, 2028. The anticipated operational seasons for road work activities is the dry season from approximately May 15 – October 15 annually. Ground based hazard tree work is anticipated to be permitted year-round and must comply with required protections for wet season operations and IFPL. Description of Work: The objectives of this project are to reduce the risks of hazardous fuels that have fallen across or remain standing along important access routes within the 2020 fire-affected road system so that access to and through the burned area can be restored. Activities include performing mitigation of risk along roads from fire killed/damaged trees, reduction of roadside fuel accumulation and essential maintenance and reconstruction of roads. The following work activities shall be required. The work shall be broken out as Mandatory and Optional work in the solicitation. Cut and remove fire killed trees within 100 feet of roads (approximately 176 acres designated as Mandatory and 300 acres Optional). Hazard trees to be cut are Designated by Prescription. Fall and leave non-commercial hazard trees within Special Measure Areas (SMAs). SMAs may include Riparian Reserves, cultural resource areas, wildlife habitat protection areas or other areas that requires special protections. This work is located within 100 feet of the road. SMAs do not overlap acres that require the cutting and removal of fire killed trees. Approximately 161 acres are designated as Mandatory and 332 acres Optional. Within unit polygons, fall and leave hazard trees that can strike the road outside of the 100-foot fuels removal area (approximately 10 acres designated as Mandatory and 40 acres Optional). Perform small fuels treatment within 30 feet of roads (approximately 200 acres designated as Mandatory and 257 acres Optional). Fuel to be treated includes existing downed or cut trees less than 16-inch DBH that do not meet the fuel loading standard. Material can be removed using a variety of methods. Piling of fuels for burning is not allowed. Perform road reconstruction during the dry season (May 15-October 15). Mandatory construction work includes 9 miles standard ditch and 32 miles road reconditioning, 9 culvert replacements with sizes that vary from 24 to 60-inch culvert, approximately 27,000 SF of reinforced soil slope construction, 4 miles of full depth reclamation, 9,500 tons of asphalt concrete placement, and placement of approximately 14,500 CY of sub-base and 10,000 CY surface course aggregate. The Government’s estimate for the Mandatory reconstruction work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Optional construction work includes 41 miles of road reconditioning, five culvert replacements that range from 36 to 48-inch in size and placement of approximately 14,500 CY of subbase and 10,000 CY of surface course aggregate. The Government’s estimate for the Optional reconstruction work is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. **Placement of aggregate as approved by a qualified engineering COR is necessary for conditional road use during the wet weather season (October 16-May 14). Subbase would be placed prior to operations and surface course after work is completed. All aggregate shall be furnished by the government and is located in the McCoy Pit (44.69266N, 122.03350W on 2233-605). Perform pre-haul, during-haul and post-haul road maintenance within the Contract Area (approximately 40 miles Mandatory and 62 miles Optional). General T-specifications applicable to the work: blading, surfacing, maintenance for high clearance vehicle use, cutting roadway vegetation and water supply/watering. Remove hazardous fuels greater than 16” from Units LH-15, LH-63, LH-64, and LH64B (53 acres) that are within 100 feet of the road. These fire-killed trees are in the McCoy Recreation Area and were cut in fall of 2024. Commercially viable material may be scaled and removed from National Forest System lands. Non-commercial material may be chipped, or disposed of at the contractor’s discretion but must be removed from NFS lands until maximum fuel loading standards are met. This is a Mandatory work item. Fall and leave individual hazard trees that are outside of units but within striking distance of the road (not-to-exceed 1500 individual trees). Designated trees adjacent to the listed units that fall outside the unit polygon but are still tall enough to fall and strike the road (adjusted for slope), shall be felled. Trees felled into the 100-foot removal area must be left on site and will count towards the downed wood requirement. Trees to be felled must be pre-approved by a COR prior to cutting. Contractors will track individual trees that are felled with a log of GPS points and date of COR approval. This is an Optional work item. Equipment required for tree cutting will operate from within the road prism if slopes exceed 30%. Equipment may be utilized off the road prism on slopes <30% during the normal operating season (May 15th to October 15th) using slash mats. Equipment may also be allowed to operate on frozen soils/packed snow with approval from the Forest Service. See table below for estimated treatment acres by slope generated from LiDAR data. Shape files will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.sam.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 855-3552. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

Offerors much clearly demonstrate experience in each of the seven areas identified above in projects meeting the required timeframe and meeting the requirements set forth in this Criterion or the Offeror will be considered to have not met this Criterion. If the firm was the Designer of Record on a design-build, the design portion of the project must be clearly stated as Design Completion Date and have been completed within the seven (7) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this Synopsis to qualify as demonstrating design experience. The offeror must clearly state the project completion date or, if design-build, the Design Completion Date, or the project will not be considered. If more than the maximum number of projects are submitted, the Government will only evaluate projects up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation. All projects provided in the SF330 must be completed by the actual office/branch/regional office/individual team member proposed to manage and perform work under this contract. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation. To enable verification, firms should include the Unique Entity Identifier number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part 1, Section F, block 25, “Firm Name” Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).

The Government will consider projects for the offeror when performed as a subcontractor or if the offeror worked as a joint venture partner. For projects performed as a subcontractor or as a joint venture involving different partners, the offeror must specify the value of the work performed as a subcontractor or as a joint venture partner and identify the offeror’s specific roles and responsibilities performed as a subcontractor or as a joint venture partner on the project rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. Additionally, the offeror must demonstrate how its work as a subcontractor or as a joint venture partner met the requirements set forth in this Criterion in order for the project to be considered. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, and the work performed by the offeror does not meet the requirements set forth in this Criterion, the project could be eliminated from consideration. NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects may be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of seven (7) projects.

Joint ventures that do not provide experience or experience meeting this Criterion’s requirements for all members of the joint venture team may be rated lower. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract and clearly demonstrate how that work meets this Criterion’s requirements. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project and how that work meets this Criterion’s requirements, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.

Changing the name of the requirement from: MDA Integration & Operations for Enterprise Solutions (MIOES) to: MDA IT Operations & Engineering Solutions (MIOES). 2. Posting May and June MIOES Monthly Exchanges with Industry slides tiltled ""MIOES Industry Monthly Chargeback Showback - May"" and ""MIOES Industry Monthly CSSP - June"" 9 April 2024 Amended Posting current IRES PWSs (not MIOES) and slides from the February and April MIOES Monthly Exchanges with Industry meetings (No slides were presented at the March meeting). The scope from the following IRES task orders will be included in the MIOES contract and it is expected that at approximately 80% of the scope will be similar under MIOES: 1500, 3100, 4100, 5900, 7300, 8004, 8600, 8900. The scope for task order 8002, under the MIOES contract, will only include scope for the MDIOC Systems Engineering and Integration requirements. All internal Program Integration currently identified under the IRES contract will continue to be a separate MIOES task order or become part of each individual task order under the MIOES contract. The basic scope for IRES task orders 8003 and 8700 will be similar. However, the requirements will be split into multiple task orders and the objectives and outcomes will look different. It is also expected that all common core IT requirements currently under IRES task order 8003 will transition to DISA over the life of the MIOES contract. It is expected the common core requirements will be identified in a MIOES task order when the contract begins but will transition incrementally over a period of time. This is a DoD mandate. MDA is currently in the planning phases of the migration with DISA. Note: The above information is subject to change. 1 November 2023 Amended OCI Guidance Attached with this amendment 6 September 2023 Amended Monthly exchanges with industry On the first Wednesday of every month the MIOES acquisition team will meet with industry for roughly one hour to discuss updates on the acquisition. Some of these meetings will include technical SMEs to discuss some of the technical requirements of the program. In order to receive a link to attend these meetings, please email mdamioes@mda.mil 5 April 2023 Amended Updated the list of industry POCs Added IRES Attachment J-01, Enclosure 1, HLO Capabilities. Industry said the embedded file at the end of J-01 could not be opened. Please remember, the High Level Objectives (HLO) were specifically organized for IRES and may not be indicative of how MIOES will be organized. 3 January 2023 Amended Amended to update the list of industry POCs for additions 10 November 2022 Amended Amended to update the list of industry POCs for errors and omissions. The Government is posting a listing of the companies and POCs from our recent market research industry day. We hope this helps companies interact and develop working relationships as we engage in the acquisition strategy. Additionally, a common theme during our discussions with industry was to provide as much information early in the process. With that in mind, we are providing the conformed solicitation from the current IRES contract. This was previously available on SAM.gov under solicitation H95001-15-R-0001 in 2016 but the documents were controlled. This release will include the full conformed (amendment 8) solicitation with the exception of the bidders library and property list, both are severely outdated. If you are seeking additional documents from the original solicitation or any of the 7 amendments, please contact mdamioes@mda.mil. Obviously, the IRES solicitation was posted after MDA developed an acquisition strategy and the documents reflect that strategy. MDA has not determined an acquisition strategy for the MIOES effort and we are diligently reviewing all of the submitted capability statements. The scope of MIOES may be similar, but not identical to the IRES scope. Please do not infer the release of the IRES solicitation is indicative of the Government's intended acquisition strategy nor exact scope."

It is a key component in the Army's weapons, business, and training systems and is embedded into the enterprise processes that make the Department function. These systems enable the Army to detect and track adversaries, protect operations from cyber threats, and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of decisions and actions. Software drives improved outcomes and effectiveness in our missions and operations. Consequently, the Army's ability to rapidly develop, deliver, and adapt resilient software is critical to achieving a competitive advantage over adversaries. Army Contracting Command – Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is pursuing a new Multiple Award Indefinite Quanty Indefinite Delivery Contract for Modern Software Development for which task orders will be issued for software enablement efforts in support of Army systems. For the purposes of this action, a “software enablement effort” is defined as: (a) development of a custom software solution; (b) customization, integration, or modification of a software solution; (c) software as a service enablement; or (d) software security and hosting modernization. How you can help: ACC-APG seeks your input on the proposed contract strategy (Appendix 1), initial Statement of Objectives (Appendix 2), and answers to our targeted questions (Appendix 3). Specifically, we are seeking suggestions on how to establish a phased source selection that will enable the Army to award an effective and expedited Multiple Award contract to the most qualified contractors.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed fluorinated alkyl ether containing epoxies designed as an anti-insect coating. The robust and durable coating was developed to improve aircraft efficiency, but the coating could be useful in a variety of applications where reduction of insect residue adherence is desirable, such as in automotive and wind energy industries. This technology is a copolymeric epoxy coating that is loaded with a fluorinated aliphatic chemical species and nano- to microscale particle fillers. The coating was developed as a hydrophobic and non-wetting coating for aerodynamic surfaces to prevent accumulation of insect strike remains that can lead to natural laminar flow disruption and aerodynamic inefficiencies. The coating achieves hydrophobicity in two ways. First, the fluorinated aliphatic chemical species are hydrophobic surface modification additives that preferentially migrate to the polymer surface that is exposed to air. Secondly, the incorporation of particle fillers produces a micro-textured surface that displays excellent resistance to wetting. Combined, these two factors increase hydrophobicity and can also be used to readily generate superhydrophobic surfaces.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed a novel polymer material that can be utilized as a real-time structural health monitoring sensor. The material is electroactive and generates a signal in response to a mechanical force. The material is also highly elastic, which allows for a large range of measurable strain levels, and is highly durable. The material is manufactured into micro- and/or nanofibers from polyvinylidene fluoride, or PVDF, a thermoplastic fluoropolymer that is highly piezoelectric when poled. The material can either be spun directly onto composite panels or can be embedded within the material. Defect detection is captured as the result of the piezoelectric PVDF fibers acting similarly to wires. The fabrication method of the electroactive material is based on a previous NASA Langley invention of an apparatus that is used to electrospin highly aligned polymer fiber material. A description of the fabrication method can be found in the technology opportunity announcement titled Highly Electrospun Fibers and Mats, which is available on NASA Langley Technology Gateway.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: Researchers at NASAs Langley Research Center have developed a simple, compact, easy-to-use projection focusing schlieren imaging system optical assembly that leverages a light source, a single physical grid element, and polarization optics to enable hi-res flow visualization. The assembly can simply be mounted in front of a camera to enable focusing schlieren imaging capability. The assembly was designed to drastically reduce the complexity and time required to align a focusing schlieren imaging experiment. Conventional focusing schlieren imaging systems and projection-based analogs require cumbersome grid alignment and peripheral resources to function (e.g., separate source and cutoff grids, projectors, specialized software). NASAs system leverages a single physical grid as both the source and cutoff grid, so the system is self-aligned, compact, does not require specialized software, and costs less than other projection-based alternatives. NASAs single grid, self-aligned focusing schlieren optical assembly is attached to a commercial-off-the-shelf camera. It directs light from the light source through a condenser lens and linear polarizer towards a polarizing beam-splitter where the linear, vertically-polarized component of light is reflected onto the optical axis of the instrument. The light passes through a Ronchi ruling grid, a polarizing prism, and a quarter-wave plate prior to projection from the assembly as right-circularly polarized light. The grid-patterned light (having passed through the Ronchi grid) is directed past the density object onto a retroreflective background that serves as the source grid. Upon reflection off the retroreflective background, the polarization state of light is mirrored. It passes the density object a second time and is then reimaged by the system. Upon encountering the polarizing prism the second time, the light is refracted resulting in a slight offset. This refracted light passes through the Ronchi ruling grid, now serving as the cutoff grid, for a second time before being imaged by the camera. Both small- and large-scale experimental set ups have been evaluated and shown to be capable of fields-of-view of 10 and 300 millimeters respectively. Observed depths of field were found to be comparable to existing systems. Light sources, polarizing prisms, retroreflective materials and lenses can be customized to suit a particular experiment. For example, with a high speed camera and laser light source, the system has collected flow images at a rate of 1MHz.

A request for an extension will not be granted. Attached are our responses to some of the questions (644 – 674) that we have received. We are not incorporating these into an amendment since it would cause Offerors that have already submitted proposals in PIEE to completely redo their proposals. Additionally, it is our understanding that when files are saved and uploaded into the PIEE system that the special characters associated with the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 may not appear. Please continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9. If the special characters are replaced with “_” or are omitted when the files are saved or uploaded to PIEE, Offerors will not be deemed non-compliant. However, Offerors must continue to abide by the naming conventions required in Attachment 9 regardless of this issue. 3/28/2024 - Update Amendment 0002 to 70SBUR24R0000001 has been issued to incorporate changes that have been made to the Solicitation Cover Page, Part II - Contract Clauses, Part III – Terms and Conditions and Attachments, and Part IV – Solicitation Provisions/ Instructions/ Evaluation (extended the proposal submission date), update the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Offer Template and incorporate the questions and answers. If you have started to submit or have submitted your offer, you should receive an email notification stating that a new amendment has been issued.

Inquiries regarding MAPSS should be submitted by email to MAPSS@mda.mil. Update- The Government is providing an update to the MAPSS Tranches. This special notice is intended to communicate to industry the projected general approach for the MDA Agile Professional Services Solutions (MAPSS) procurement which is the follow-on to TEAMS-Next. MAPSS is MDA’s fourth generation professional services program providing Advisory and Assistance Services support for the Agency. Under the MAPSS Program, the Government intends to conduct market research and acquisition strategy development incrementally in 4 tranches to help ensure decisions are relevant for requirements that in some cases won’t begin until FY 2029. Requirements structure, NAICS Codes, small business set-aside decisions, and other elements of the strategy informed by market conditions will be determined based on current market research during planning for each tranche. As part of the market research for the first tranche, MDA is evaluating the potential use of the General Services Administration’s (GSA) OASIS+ Best-in-Class (BIC) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi-Agency Contracts (MAC). Industry is encouraged to prepare and posture themselves to compete in this environment in the event that MDA determines that the OASIS+ Contracts best accommodate the Government’s requirements. Vendors interested in learning more about OASIS+ can find information on GSA’s Interact Portal (https://buy.gsa.gov/interact/community/196/activity-feed). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Government is not requesting responses to this notice. Further notifications, market research, and solicitation activities for requirements under the MAPSS Program will be posted at a later time.

Federal Agency Name: Air Force Research Laboratory ARA Title: Neutron Strategic Technology Advanced Research (Neutron STAR) Advanced Research Announcement (ARA) ARA Type: This is an Open ARA; initial announcement SUBMISSION DATES ARE INDEFIINITE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE PROGRAM SUMMARY: This is an Open ARA announcement pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. §4023 Procurement for Experimental Purposes. AFRL is interested in receiving white papers regarding nuclear-related research and development, including, but not limited to modeling and simulation of re-entry environments, materials characterization, nuclear explosion monitoring, and design, fabrication and experimentation of nuclear delivery. Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged. This solicitation intends to use the acquisition authority provided by 10 U.S.C. §4023. This authority applies to the acquisition of items related to “…ordnance, signal, chemical activity, transportation, energy, medical, spaceflight, and aeronautical supplies, including parts and accessories, and designs thereof, that are necessary for experimental or test purposes in the development of the best supplies that are needed for the national defense.” Consequently, white papers and proposals should address how the proposed effort provides benefits to the national defense relative to the parameters of this authority, and a strategy for verifying those intended benefits. *Please see the attached Neutron Star Industry User Guide for guidance on definitions, processes, submission requirements and evaluation criteria.* BACKGROUND: AFRL’s Geo Space Division (RVBN) positions AFRL to steward, develop, and deliver leading technologies to the warfighter and the nuclear enterprise to ensure the National defense. Thus, proposed solutions should be innovative and substantially improve national defense capabilities across the domains of national nuclear deterrence operations. While the Government describes discrete topic areas below, it also anticipates that certain comprehensive technology solutions and prototypes may require multidiscipline approaches that address two or more topic areas. The topic areas covered under this announcement may be used in any combination. The Government reserves the right to add, delete or modify the topic areas as necessary. Industry-Government Communication: Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged throughout the life of this ARA. However, communication shall be limited to the Contracting/Agreement Officer once full proposals are submitted for evaluation/review. Discussions should focus on understanding Government objectives and requirements, feasibility of prospective offeror approach, and prospective offeror prior similar efforts. Discussions shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. No guidance related to technical approach will be given. Offerors are advised that only Contracting or Agreement Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government. ANNOUNCEMENT DETAILS: This is a HYBRID ANNOUNCEMENT. This announcement includes an open request for white papers as described below. Additionally, individual solicitations for white papers (Two-Step solicitation) and/or proposals (One-Step solicitation) related to discrete requirements may be issued. AFRL reserves the right to collapse a white paper (Two-Step solicitation) into a One-Step if the situation warrants and the white paper contains sufficient technical detail to do full technical proposal evaluation instead of white paper evaluation. Open Announcement Request: AFRL/RVBN is soliciting white papers on the research effort described in the below topic areas pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. §4023, Procurement for Experimental Purposes. White papers submitted pursuant to the open announcement request follow the two-step procedures described below. White papers submitted under the open announcement request may be retained for 12 months. Open Announcement Submission: Unclassified White papers must be submitted to the Neutron Star Org Box at afrl.rvkb.afrlneutronstardms@us.af.mil. DO NOT DELIVER any classified portion of the white paper to this address. If it is determined that a classified white paper is required, please contact the Neutron STAR Org Mailbox for specific delivery instructions. Additional instructions for white paper submissions can be found in the Neutron STAR Industry User Guide attached to this announcement. Individual Solicitation Request: Individual Solicitations, except for Limited Solicitations, for white papers and proposals will be issued under this announcement via the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at https://sam.gov. Notification of Individual Solicitations may be announced on other platforms (i.e. www.grants.gov) and will direct Offerors to the GPE for full solicitation details. Individual Solicitation Submissions: Submission requirements for Individual Solicitations will be specified in the solicitation details of each Individual Solicitation. Individual Solicitation Variations: Variations of the ARA Individual Solicitation process are available for use. The following types are commonly used but are not considered all inclusive. One-Step: The one-step process is used to request full technical and cost proposals from each Offeror. The proposals are reviewed in accordance with the solicitation criteria and typically all, part, or none of a proposal may be selected for award. Two-Step: The two-step process is used to request white papers and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs. The Individual Solicitation must state whether an unfavorable white paper review will bar the Offeror from further consideration. The Government may retain unselected white papers for a specific period, which will be identified in the individual solicitation. White papers submitted under the open announcement request may be retained for 12 months. Full proposals are requested from those Offerors selected in the white paper review process. After proposals are received, they are processed and reviewed in accordance with the One-Step process. Limited Individual Solicitations: This approach allows for solicitation to a limited group of potential offerors. Request for Proposals (RFP) or Requests for white papers will be issued directly to potential offerors without a requirement to publish to the GPE. The Government may issue solicitations that combine one or more of the above approaches. Announcement Modifications: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of US nuclear deterrent mission and warfighter needs, this announcement is subject to updates, revisions, or additional topic areas. Therefore, Offerors are highly encouraged to continually monitor https://sam.gov to ensure they receive the latest guidance for this announcement. The Government shall provide updates to this announcement no less than annually. Updates may include changes to topic areas, submission requirements, administrative changes, evaluation criteria, solicitation methods, etc. (not an inclusive list). Type of Contract/Instrument: The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract, agreement or assistance instrument type under the authorities below: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10 U.S.C. §4021 ""Other Transaction for Research” 10 U.S.C. §4022 ""Other Transaction for Prototype"" 10 U.S.C. §4023 ""Procurement for Experimental Purposes"" 15 U.S.C §3710a – Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements 15 U.S.C §3715 – Partnership Intermediaries 32 C.F.R. §22.215 – Grants and Cooperative Agreements The Government anticipates that a mix of contract/ instrument types will be used throughout the life of this announcement. Generally, awards under this announcement or any Individual Solicitations may be Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (Completion and Term), Cost Reimbursement, Firm Fixed Price, Cost Sharing, and Incentive. NOTE: If a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) type contract is recommended as the award type authority, then the FAR clauses will be referenced at the Individual Solicitation level or within the Request for Proposal. The FAR and FAR supplement provisions and clauses will be incorporated by reference. The full text of these provisions and clauses can be found at https://www.acquisition.gov. If an assistance instrument (grants or cooperative agreements) is recommended as the award type, then articles and guidance found under DoDGARS, 200 CFR, OMB/DoD Policy shall be used and followed as appropriate. If an Other Transaction (OT) is recommended as the award type, then the FAR references and clauses will not apply. The terms and conditions of an OT agreement shall be developed and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Estimated Program Cost: The overarching announcement has an unrestricted ceiling. However, Individual Solicitations may elect to provide an estimated program value or funding profile for planning purposes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY, is seeking innovative research that revolutionizes air operations planning by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven planning with interactive gaming to significantly reduce the Air Tasking Order planning cycle. Human-guided AI will generate myriad potential courses of action and the gaming environment will allow operators to explore, cull, and evaluate combat plans, gaining insight into the future battlespace. The over-arching strategy of this five (5) year open BAA is to quickly and efficiently execute research and development to deliver practical solutions to urgent problems. These efforts are anticipated to entail rapidly integrating existing technology into field testable, functional prototypes of solutions to military problems in two (2) major Focus Areas: Technical Area 1 (TA1): Interactive Plan Refinement Technical Area 2 (TA2): Plan Gaming and Outcome Analysis This strategy provides AFRL Rome, NY a solicitation tool with the flexibility to solicit white papers and proposals for Contract or agreements to perform rapid prototyping of technical solutions to meet compelling Air Force needs. BAA ESTIMATED FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $99M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 54 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $3M to $40M. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount. Any anticipated funding listed reflects estimated program funding only. This estimate is not a promise of funding. Funding is uncertain and is subject to change. Changes in availability may occur as a result of the exercise of Government discretion. ANTICIPATED INDIVIDUAL AWARDS: Multiple Awards are anticipated. TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE AWARDED: Procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions (OT) depending upon the nature of the work proposed. In the event that an Other Transaction for Prototype agreement is awarded as a result of this competitive BAA, and the prototype project is successfully completed, there is the potential for a prototype project to transition to award of a follow-on production contract or transaction.

Individual awards will not normally exceed 30 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $3M to $40M. This BAA is only requesting submissions for Phase I. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value as long as the value does not exceed the available BAA ceiling amount. Any anticipated funding listed reflects estimated program funding only. This estimate is not a promise of funding. Funding is uncertain and is subject to change. Changes in availability may occur as a result of the exercise of Government discretion.

SEE ATTACHMENT FOR FULL AMENDMENT DETAILS. AMENDMENT 2 TO BAA FA8750-22-S-7001 The purpose of this amendment is to: Part I, Overview Information is updated to revise the due date for proposals under TA1 and TA2 as shown below: PART I – OVERVIEW INFORMATION This announcement is for an Open, 2 Step BAA, with a partial Closed-Staggered, 2 Step BAA for Technical Area 1 (TA1) and Technical Area 2 (TA2), which is open and effective until 30 Nov 2026. Only white papers will be accepted as initial submissions; formal proposals will be accepted by invitation only. While white papers will be considered if received prior to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 30 Nov 2026, the following submission dates are suggested to best align with projected funding: Technical Area 1 (TA1) and Technical Area 2 (TA2) are structured as a Closed-Staggered, 2 Step BAA. Therefore, for TA1 and TA2 ONLY: The Government anticipates awarding two awards for Technical Area 1 and two awards for Technical Area 2. Therefore, white papers for TA1 and TA2 are due on 10 JAN 2022 and if requested, proposals are due on 4 MAR 2022. Please note that white papers will still be accepted for TA1 and TA2 after the 10 JAN 2022 date, however, the likelihood of funding being available is substantially reduced. For all other Technical Areas: The Government anticipates adding technical areas via BAA amendment in the future. All potential Offerors are requested to wait to submit white papers until the BAA announcement is updated with specific technology requirements and dates. Part II, Full Text Announcement, Section IV Application and Submission Information is updated to revise the due date for proposals under Task 2 as shown below: SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by 4 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: Technical Area 1 (TA1) and Technical Area 2 (TA2) are structured as a Closed-Staggered, 2 Step BAA. Therefore, for TA1 andTA2 ONLY: The Government anticipates awarding two awards for Technical Area 1 and two awards for Technical Area 2. Therefore, white papers for TA1 and TA2 are due on 10 JAN 2022 and if requested, proposals are due on 4 MAR 2022. Please note that white papers will still be accepted for TA1 and TA2 after the 10 JAN 2022 date, however, the likelihood of funding being available is substantially reduced. For all other Technical Areas: The Government anticipates adding technical areas via BAA amendment in the future. All potential Offerors are requested to wait to submit white papers until the BAA announcement is updated with specific technology requirements and dates. White papers will be accepted until 4 PM EST on 30 Nov 2026, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. This BAA will close on 30 Nov 2026. All offerors submitting white papers will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission. Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their white paper(s) after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received. Section VI.4.d, adds new language as shown below: ACTIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CONTROLLED INFORMATION, KEY PERSONNEL AND CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. Offerors who are requested to submit a proposal under this solicitation of grants, cooperative agreements, Technology Investment Agreements, and other non-procurement transactions only shall submit specific information for all key personnel, whether or not the individuals’ efforts under the project are to be funded by the DoD. Specific requirements will be detailed in the Request for Proposal (RFP) letter. The information shall be included in the Research and Related/Key Person Profile (Expanded) form (https://www.grants.gov/forms/r-r-family.html). This collection only applies to persons identified as key personnel. This information shall not be included in the overall proposal page limits. Failure to submit this information may cause the proposal to be returned without further review, and the DoD reserves the right to request further details before making a final determination on funding an effort. This information will be used to support protection of intellectual property, controlled information, key personnel, and information about critical technologies relevant to national security. Additionally, this information will be used to limit undue influence, including foreign talent programs, by countries that desire to exploit United States’ technology within the DoD research, science and technology, and innovation enterprise. Certification Regarding Disclosure of Funding Sources By submission of a white paper/proposal, you agree to abide by the following statement: ""By signing this white paper/proposal, I certify the proposing entity is in compliance with Section 223(a) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 which requires that: (a) the PI and other key personnel certify that the current and pending support provided on the proposal is current, accurate and complete; (b) the PI and other key personnel agree to update such disclosure at the request of the agency prior to the award of support and at any subsequent time the agency determines appropriate during the term of the award; and (c) the PI and other key personnel have been made aware of the requirements under Section 223(a)(1) of this Act. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or claims may subject me to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. (U.S. code, Title 218, Section 1001). Section VII; Agency Contacts, updates the OMBUDSMAN as follows: In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Oct 2019) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows: Mr. Steven Ewers 1864 4th Street WPAFB OH 45433 Phone: (937) 904-9700 FAX: (937) 656-7321 afrl.pk.workflow@us.af.mil No other changes are made. PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT FOR AMENDMENT 2 Amendment No. 3 to BAA FA8750-22-S-7001 The purpose of this amendment is to: Section III, Eligibility Information, adds the following paragraph 5 for S&T Protection: 5. In accordance with AFRLI 61-113, S&T Protection, Contractors/Recipients are required to submit with their proposal a Standard Form 424, ""Research and Related and Senior and Key Person Profile (Expanded), as well as a Security Program Questionnaire, which are included in the RI-Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions and can be accessed at: https://sam.gov/opp/e628c811fafe041accdddf55fb8539bf/view?keywords=AFRL-BAA-GUIDE&sort=-relevance&index=&is_active=true&page=1.

Complete and submit the required forms with your proposal to the technical point of contact (TPOC) listed in Section VII-Agency Contacts AND AFRL.RIOF@us.af.mil. Contractors will be required to provide documentation of their Security Program Plan for initial Institution S&T Protection Program Review. The purpose of requesting the plan is to evaluate the offeror’s capacity for protecting the Government’s S&T and failure to demonstrate a plan adequate to meet the needs of the requirement may be grounds for considering the proposal unawardable. In the event a security risk is identified and the Government has determined the security risk exceeds the acceptable threshold, the Contractor/Recipient will be notified and informed of the termination/decline of award. The Government will be only required to provide a general statement of the reasoning due to Government OPSEC measures. After award, the Contractor/Recipient will be required to re-submit the Standard Form 424 as an annual requirement to the points of contact listed above. No other changes are made.

This draft posting is for information and planning purposes only and is not a guarantee that a Final SIR will be released. All draft SIR sections are still in draft form and subject to change. Responses to the draft SIR will be used for informational purposes only. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information received or for administrative costs incurred in preparing a response to the draft SIR. Any costs associated with responding to the draft SIR are solely at the interested vendor’s expense. The FAA is seeking feedback on the draft SIR using Attachment 1, Vendor Comment Matrix. The FAA also requests that vendors provide responses to the following items: Are the requirements identified in the draft SIR sufficiently detailed to allow you to propose and price your solution? If not, what additional information is needed? Are there requirements that are too restrictive or constraining that would hinder your ability to offer your proposed solution? If so, please provide your recommendations to make the requirement(s) less restrictive. Do the CLIN Contract types (ie, FFP) in Section B support the draft work efforts identified in the PWS? If not, please provide your recommendations to better align Contract type to work effort. Do the CLIN Contract types provide sufficient flexibility to adequately price your solution? If not, please provide your recommendations to improve flexibility. Do the draft SIR requirements support the ability to achieve the objectives identified in Attachment J-0, CSS-FD Strategy? Please explain. Are there any draft SIR requirements that conflict with or hinder the ability to achieve the objectives identified in Attachment J-0? If so, please identify the conflicting requirements. Do the interdependencies on current and future operational programs and systems in Attachment J-0 provide enough context to enable you to propose your solution? If not, what additional information is required? Does the strategy of providing a Common Support Services Flight Data Business Rules document (Section J Attachment J-X, to be provided with the final SIR), in combination with requirements in Attachment J-1, Section 3.2, Business Rules Management System (BRMS), facilitate understanding of the FAA’s intended approach? Please explain. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS Interested parties must provide responses in writing. Responses must be in common electronic readable format (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF), single-spaced, in Time New Roman 12 Font. Responses must be submitted electronically no later than 11:AM EST on January 12, 2024 to the Contracting Officer, Maria Ashby at Maria.J.Ashby@faa.gov. The responses to this Draft SIR will be used for information purposes only and will not be released, except as required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Any proprietary or confidential information contained in the Draft SIR submissions must be appropriately marked. Proprietary information that is appropriately marked will be protected in accordance with FOIA. Additionally, providing a response to this Draft SIR neither qualifies respondents for, nor excludes respondents from, responding to a resulting Final SIR, if any. Questions regarding the Draft SIR must be emailed to the CO. The inquiry and any subsequent response will not be considered part of the market survey response. Phone calls will not be accepted.

Original Posting (January 6th, 2023): INTERESTED PARTIES MUST REQUEST AUTOSTANDARDS ACCOUNTS BY FEBRUARY 17, 2023, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED BELOW** The General Services Administration's (GSA) Automotive Acquisition Support Center invites firms interested in submitting offers under the Government's upcoming 2024 model year solicitation for the 2024 Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Vehicle Program beginning June 2023. This process, conducted via GSA's AutoStandards web application, assists GSA Automotive to develop the Government's technical requirements for motor vehicles. Vehicle types being sought by the Government for this program include, but are not limited to: - Sedans and Passenger Station Wagons - Passenger Vans - Sport Utility Vehicles (crossovers and full-size) - Pickup trucks - Vocational Body Trucks - Wheelchair & Ambulance Vehicles - Medium & Heavy Trucks include: dump, stake, cargo vans, refrigerated vans, and tractors - Passenger Shuttle Buses (16-60) In order for a particular model to be proposed and available in AutoBid, GSA’s price proposal submission system, once the final solicitation is released, the model must be created and technical data provided to GSA during the AutoStandards process. Due to Systems limitations, there will not be an opportunity to submit alternative models after the release of the solicitation. Prospective offerors may choose to submit a proposal under any model created during the AutoStandards process once the solicitation is issued, but all prospective offerors will be limited to the models with technical data submitted during AutoStandards. Additional information will be provided during the Pre-Solicitation Conference. The General Services Administration is the mandatory source for vehicles purchased in the United States under the Federal Property Management Regulation (FPMR) 101-26.501. GSA's Vehicle Purchasing Division purchases an estimated 50,000 new model year non-tactical vehicles for Federal Executive Agencies and the Department of Defense annually. All GSA vehicle purchases are governed by program specific Federal Vehicle Standards, which are assimilated by GSA Engineering personnel prior to solicitation publication. The AutoStandards process engages interested parties to provide technical data for vehicles to be potentially offered to the Government in response to these forthcoming solicitations and to assist in development of the Federal Vehicles Standards for the current model year and specific program. As noted above, all prospective models must be established during the AutoStandards process in order to be included in AutoBid once the final solicitation is released. Please note, GSA is NOT requesting pricing at this time. GSA is currently only in the requirements development phase of the acquisition. Interested parties must complete the following steps prior to February 17, 2023, in order to participate: 1) Interested parties are required to request an AutoStandards account no later than February 17, 2023. A user name and password is obtained by submitting the attached “Request for AutoStandards Account” document, complete with all necessary information, to automotiveedi.partnerships@gsa.gov. GSA intends to open AutoStandards on Tuesday, February 21, 2023, and close it for vendor technical data submission on Monday, May 8, 2023. 2) Interested parties must review the list of makes/models being sought and submit any additional models for consideration to John Hampson, GSA Vehicle Engineer Branch Chief, at john.hampson@gsa.gov by February 17, 2023. Please see the attached “Current Active Models” as a starting point and identify any additions with your firm’s submission.

Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, ""The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984"" and subsequent amendments. ARI is the Army’s lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, and Soldier and leader development issues. Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness. Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle. Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the proposed R&D warrants further inquiry. If the proposed R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a white paper or proposal will be entertained. The recommended three-step sequence is (1) initial contact with the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) proposal submission. This sequence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and minimizes the labor and cost associated with submission of proposals that have minimal probability of being selected for funding. Costs associated with white paper or proposal submissions in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges to any resulting award. These costs may be allowable expenses to normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18. Applicants submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Government Contracting or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds. To be eligible for an award under this announcement, a prospective awardee must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources and responsibility, ability to comply with the performance schedule, past performance, integrity, experience, technical capabilities, operational controls, and facilities. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the Army."

The resources may be used in the protection of lands, to include but not be limited to, severity, fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. The USFS Equipment & Services Contracting Branch (ESB) in tandem with Regional Program Office Representatives will determine annually whether it is in the Government?s best interest to initiate an open season on-ramping process to add additional Contractors and/or resources during the annual Contracting Officer (CO) review period noted in Section C.3.1 of the solicitation. RATES: Proposed rates should be based on up to a 16hr. Daily Shift and include all within B.2 -- PRICING AND ESTIMATED QUANTITY. Note: D.21.8.1 -- Rates of Payments. Payment will be at the rates specified in the agreement that is in effect at the time of the order. DISPATCH CENTER: Agreements will be competitively awarded within the Regional dispatch centers. Agreement intent and Government guidance is for Quoters to select the available dispatch center closest to their resource location in order to reasonably meet the Government?s (Host Agency?s) date and time needed for emergency incident support, as well as offer best value to the Government for travel costs for each potential dispatch/BPA Call. Since wildland fire support and locations are unknown at time of award, selection of a host dispatch center/zone outside of where the resources reside may result in loss of opportunity and failure to meet Government?s critical and timely need at time of incident.

It is expected that TSA will release multiple open architecture artifacts and this notice serves as the centralized point for future efforts. This notice will be updated as appropriate. The TSA’s mission is to protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure the freedom of movement for people and commerce. To achieve this mission in an evolving threat environment, TSA must remain an agile and flexible organization that can rapidly field innovative screening solutions that improve TSA’s security posture. It is essential that TSA implements these innovative screening solutions in a manner that supports the Transportation Security Officer in conducting the critical screening functions and improves the passenger experience. Open Architecture is a design approach where components, such as software and hardware, are standards-based and interoperable to allow a wide range of industry partners to create improved subcomponents (e.g., new detection algorithms, user interfaces, reporting systems, etc.). Leveraging an open architecture design approach will enable TSA to improve its security posture, support its frontline workforce, and promote an improved traveler experience. The successful implementation of this approach will require coordination across a wide range of partners to include government agencies, regulators, industry and international partners, national labs, academia, and airports. _________________________________ The attached Roadmap is being issued in draft form to elicit comments from Industry. Comments are requested to be provided within twenty-one days of this posting/no later than March 2, 2023 via the attached Excel spreadsheet titled “OA Roadmap Industry Comments.” The Government will review Industry comments for market research purposes only. The Government does not intend to provide a response to comments submitted for this Roadmap; however, based on vendor comments, the Government may arrange a technical information exchange to clarify or expand on comments provided. This Roadmap does not commit the U.S. Government to any course of action in the future. The Government may or may not utilize Industry suggestions in finalizing the Roadmap and information based on comments may be shared with the public in the final draft of the Roadmap. No proprietary information shall be provided by Industry. Each respondent, by submitting comments, agrees that any costs incurred in providing comments shall be the sole responsibility of the respondent/vendor. The Government shall incur no obligations or liabilities whatsoever, to anyone, for costs or expenses incurred by the respondent/vendor in responding to this Request for Comments."

NOTES 6.1 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.2 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings. There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3 1.

This BAA will remain open for five years from the date of release. The scope of this BAA is limited to projects that meet Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions in the TRL range of 3-6 (see ATTACHMENT 1 for TRL definitions). Upon completion of the proposed development efforts, solutions should strive to meet a TRL in the range of 4-6. Proposals that address technologies at TRL 4 or greater should also be aware of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) considerations. The DTRA RD-CB mission was established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide state-of-the-art defense capabilities to allow military forces of the United States to operate and to successfully complete their missions in chemical and biological warfare environments. The scope of mission efforts and the priorities assigned to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) science and technology, advanced developments, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. To keep pace with defense capability requirements, the CBD Program (CBDP), as part of its mission, routinely promulgates chemical and biological research. The comprehensive research program encompasses both intramural and extramural sources, and the role of each is vital to the fulfillment of the CBDP objectives. DTRA is seeking optimum approaches to meet technology objectives with a goal to identify and select science and technology projects that can be transitioned to joint acquisition programs."

This combined synopsis/solicitation document is the only attachment for this amendment, al other solicitation documents remain unchanged. Update Terms & Conditions – AGAR Provision 452.222-71 Past Performance Labor Law Violations (addendum to FAR 52.12-1) and AGAR Clause 452.222-70 Labor Law Violations (addendum to FAR 52.212-4) have been rescinded. These changes will be reflected in subsequent awards. Quote Due Date & Time – Extended to 5/2/2022 @ 5p MDT. Clarifications – Exhibit 12. CWN MFSU Description & Equipment Requirements Checklist- Inspections – Before a certificate of compliance is issued authorizing performance on a BPA, a site inspection may be conducted either in-person or via other electronic methods to determine the unit is suitable for award. Further, photos are necessary to support this exhibit for evaluation purposes. Geographic Area Coordination Center (GACC) – Dispatch center for Regional/Local incidents (< 150 meals). Have access to NICC Source List for 2022 CWN MFSU BPAs. GACCs DO NOT have authority to place Orders under the BPAs. Resource Orders received from GACCs will result in separately priced EERAs written by a Buying Team or Local Contracting Office. National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) – Only agency other than the CO with authority to place orders under the BPAs. Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) – It is the governments intent to not issue EERAs for Call When Needed (CWN) MFSUs responding in support of an incident due to National MFS Units being fully committed or otherwise unavailable during the 2022 Fire Season. The purpose of 1202SC22Q2100 is to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) prior to the season in an effort to provide a more efficient dispatch process throughout, especially at times when there is an utmost need, similar to, and in-line with, current National dispatch procedures. This will eliminate time of order negotiations, allowing for quicker response to an incident. Regional/Local incidents (<150 meals) – Dispatched via GACC via EERAs from regional/local offices or buying teams. GACCs will have access to the source list comprised of all Call When Needed (CWN) MFSU BPA awardees and will follow their own ordering procedures. Regional/local incidents are separate from the CWN MFSU BPA; EERA pricing is determined at time of order based on discussions at that time with that ordering official and will not be reflected against a BPA. Western United States – All states west of ND, SD, WY, CO, NM (occasionally TX and MN). Again, Call When Needed BPAs are for use only when a National MFS is not available. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- AMENDMENT (A01): The purpose of this amendment is to update Exhibit 11: Vendor Forest Service Incident Payment Information and provide clarification on CWN MFSUs. All other solicitation documents remain unchanged / there are no attachments for this amendment. Update Invoice Issues - invoice status questions email to asc_support@usda.gov. This change will be reflected in subsequent awards. This combined synopsis/solicitation is specifically for CWN MFSUs for use after all Nationally contracted MFSUs have been ordered or determined unavailable. GACCs can access a CWN MFSU BPA source list for regional/local use. USDA Forest Service CWN MFSU BPA holders are not precluded from accepting orders from GACCs on a separate EERA: CWN MFSUs are not required to provide pricing matching current BPA prices. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BASE: This combined synopsis/solicitation and resultant Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) are to provide Call When Needed (CWN) Mobile Food Service Units (MFSUs) at various field locations during wildland fire and other types of incidents throughout the contiguous western United States after all Nationally contracted MFSUs have been ordered or determined unavailable, and as the need becomes known to the Government. The expectation and desired result of the attached Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide appetizing, nutritional, well-balanced hot/cold meals, sack lunches, hot/cold can meals and supplemental items. All meals are to be freshly prepared at the incident (please see the SOW for complete details). This acquisition will result in commercial, multiple-award BPAs, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The BPA’s may be used by multiple State and Federal wildland fire agencies and will result in multiple agreements. The dollar limitation for any individual order is the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) ($7.5M IAW Agency procedure). Since the needs of the Government and availability of Contractor's resources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed that, upon request of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the extent the Contractor is willing and able at the time of order. Due to the sporadic occurrence of incident activity, the placement of any orders IS NOT GUARANTEED. Offerors shall complete the Schedule of Items – CWN MFSUs Item Detail and Price Schedule (attached separately) for the 2022 Calendar Year for all equipment and services they propose to offer. The Contractor is responsible for furnishing and managing all equipment, materials, supplies, trained/certified personnel, laborers, transportation and lodging necessary to meet the agreement specifications as identified in the SOW. Pricing/Terms for subsequent years will be requested annually through an updated combined synopsis/solicitation posted to SAM.gov. The effective period of the resultant BPAs will be June 1, 2022 – May 31, 2032, subject to Annual Review IAW FAR 13.303-6 and custom clause #4. The physical home location of the CWN MFSUs will be considered the Designated Dispatch Point (DDP) for the Offeror’s personnel and equipment. Wildland fire and other types of incidents occur in the contiguous western United States; BPAs will be established with MFS Units located in these areas."

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1 Order of Precedence - In the event of a conflict between the text of this contract/purchase order and the references and/or drawings cited herein, the text of this contract/purchase order must take precedence. Nothing in this contract/purchase order, however, must supersede applicable laws and regulations unless a specific exemption has been obtained. 2.2 Applicable Documents - The document(s) listed below form a part of this contract/purchase order including modifications or exclusions. 2.2.1 Specification Revisions - The specification revisions listed under ""Documents References"" below are the preferred revision. Older and/or newer r evisions are acceptable when listed within Contract Support Library Reference Number CSD155 in ECDS (Electric Contractor Data Submission) at: ht tps://register.nslc.navy.mil/. This is to allow Contractors to use certain acceptable older specification revisions to purge their existing stock of material certified to those older revisions or to use newer specification revisions when material is certified to newly released revisions,without requiring the submittal of waiver/deviation requests for each specification revision on every contract. Revisions of specifications reflecting editorial and/or re-approval (e.g. E2009, R2014, etc.) are considered inconsequential, but are acceptable when their revisions are listedwithin CSD155 or elsewhere within this contract. 2.2.2 ""Document References"" listed below must be obtained by the Contractor.

All traceability marking must be permanently applied in accordance with MIL-STD-792. An alternate marking method is permissible provided it is an available option in the contractually invoked specification, except in instances where the material has been modified by this contract/purchase order, and differs from that specified in the specification. Electric arc marking or impression marking is strictly prohibited on thin wall tubing. (wall thickness of less than 0.125 inch). 3.19.2 Temporary Marking - Temporary Marking must consist of: Name or Trademark of Manufacturer, specification and grade (as applicable), size, contract number, and the traceability marking. Pipe and tube marking must also include SML (for seamless). Marking must be in accordance with the material specification and SAE-AMS-2806, SAE-AMS-2807, SAE-AMS-2809, Table I of SAE-AMS-STD-185, or ASTM-B666 as applicable. Application must be in accordance with MIL-STD-792, type A (temporary ink stenciling). An alternate method is permissible for MONEL and K-MONEL bar provided it is an available option (temporary marking only) in the applicable material specification, except that hot finished rod with rough ground surface 3/4 inch and under may be bundled and tagged or boxed with the traceability marking on the bag or box. Contamination levels for ink stenciling must be as outlined in paragraph 5.2 of MIL-STD-792. 3.20 See CDRL DI-MISC-81020 (Chemical and Mechanical) - Material Certification - In addition to the certification data requirements specified in DI-MISC-81020, the following material certification requirements apply: 3.20.1 Quantitative chemical and mechanical analysis of material traceable to traceability markings is required. Material certification test reports must include the class, form, condition, grade, type, finish, and/or composition, as applicable, of the material supplied. 3.20.2 Re-identification and re-certification of material is required when the material is subjected to a process which alters it's properties. If the starting material or raw stock is processed in a manner that will not affect its chemical composition or mechanical properties, the original certifications for the chemical composition and mechanical properties, as required by the material specification, are acceptable. Re-certification of the chemical or mechanical properties is required if a process is used during fabrication that alters the original properties of the material (e.g. alloying, heat treating, or forming). In these instances, the properties of the material must be re-determined and documented to reflect the altered condition. The altered material must be uniquely re-identified. The properties thus determined and documented, are required for final certification and must conform to the material specification or the contract/purchase order requirements. When only the mechanical properties are altered, the original certification forchemical composition must be overstamped and annotated with the unique traceability marking used with the altered material and at a minimum contain the information below. TRACEABILITY MARKING ________________________________________________ (marking on finished item) IS FABRICATED FROM RAW MATERIAL IDENTIFIED TO HEAT/LOT NUMBER ______________ AND HEAT TREAT NUMBER ______________________ (when applicable) _________________________________________ DATE _____________________ (name and signature of auth. co. rep.) 3.20.3 Material certification data forwarded by the manufacturer must contain a signed certification that the report results represent the actual attributes of the material furnished and indicate full compliance with all applicable specification and contract requirements. Transcription of certification data is prohibited. 3.20.4 Statements on material certification documents must be positive and unqualified. Disclaimers such as ""to the best of our knowledge"" or ""we believe the information contained herein is true"" are not acceptable. 3.20.5 If material is received without the required certification papers or with incorrect/missing data on the certification papers, the material will be rejected. 3.21 Material Handling - The written material control process must include the following: 3.21.1 All raw materials must have traceability markings (except as specified below). 3.21.2 Stored raw materials requiring traceability must be segregated to preclude intermingling with materials not requiring traceability. 3.21.3 When traceability markings will be removed by a manufacturing or fabrication process, the marking must be recorded prior to removal and be immediately restored upon completion of the process. If this cannot be done or is impractical, an appropriate material control procedure (such as a bag and tag, tagging, and/or tote box control) must be employed. The material control procedure must provide a method of positive control to preclude commingling of heats/lots or loss of traceability. The traceability marking must be reapplied upon completion of the final manufacturing process. 3.21.4 Purchase orders for raw material must specify that the material be traceable to material certification test reports by traceability markings on the material and identified on the test reports. The certification data requirements contained in DI-MISC-81020 must be invoked by the prime contractor on all subcontractors supplying Level I material. 3.21.5 The material control process must include requirements for the maintenance of traceability for items sent out for subcontracted operations. If such operations would remove traceability markings, purchase or work orders must specify a method and marking location for remarking. The contractor must also ensure that subcontractor production controls are adequate to preclude commingling of materials during processing. 3.22 Receiving inspection - 3.22.1 Products and services produced by sub-tier suppliers for incorporation in the contract end item must be subject to inspection or audit at the time of receipt by the prime prior to further processing within the prime contractor's plant or shipment to another location. 3.22.2 Receiving Inspection must include as a minimum - Verification that the traceability marking on the material agrees with that on the certification test reports. Verification that certification test reports are legible and complete. Verification that the contents of the certification test reports are in compliance with the contractually invoked specifications and requirements. 3.23 Discrepancy reporting - 3.23.1 Nonconforming products from sub-tier suppliers must be identified and processed in accordance with the prime contractor's procedures for controlling nonconforming products. The prime contractor must report the receipt of any nonconforming products to the responsible sub-tier supplier in accordance with established procedures. Nonconforming material records must be maintained and available for review by the government. 3.24 Final Inspection - The following inspections must be performed prior to Government inspection and acceptance. 3.24.1 Material Sampling - Material must be inspected for form, fit, and function. Lot acceptance must be based on zero defects and lot rejection based on one defect. The sample size must be in accordance with the sampling plan(s) in the applicable military specification or standard, federal specification or standard, or drawing to which the material was manufactured. In the absence of such sampling plans, sampling inspection must be per ANSI/ASQ-Z1.4, general inspection level II (for sample size selection code), table IIA (for sample size). SMALL LOT SIZES - For lot sizes of fifty or less, the minimum sample size must be eight units. For lot sizes of eight or less, the sample size must be one hundred percent of the lot. 3.24.2 The Manufacturer may elect to use Statistical Process Control (SPC) to assure product quality in lieu of the above attribute sampling plan, provided that the SPC methodology/system used provides acceptable products to the Government. However, the Government/Navy Receipt Inspection Activity may perform their acceptance inspection of the material using the attribute sampling plan outlined above. 3.24.3 All data concerning material verification (chemical, mechanical or physical properties), traceability (material certifications to material marking), and nondestructive test (NDT) certifications for material must be 100% inspected. The certification test reports must also be 100% inspected for com..."

Refer to underlined areas for the updates. The following summarizes the update: 1. Update mask requirement - neck gaiter-style face coverings will be prohibited at DOD workplace starting on 12 Oct 2020. ****************************************************************************** This notice is to all prime contractors and their subcontractors with contracts that were awarded and/or are administered by Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY & IMF). PHNSY & IMF, hereby, provides further clarification pertaining to the State of Hawaii’s 14-day self-quarantine. The State of Hawaii has a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for individuals traveling from out of state. The State has exceptions to the 14-day self-quarantine, including persons traveling to the State or inter-island to perform critical infrastructure functions. The State of Hawaii has provided waivers to individuals regarding the 14-day quarantine when arriving from out of state. However, current PHNSY & IMF guidance does not allow for travelers coming from off-island to enter the DOD workplace for 14 days after arrival, regardless if the individual has a waiver from the State. This includes the workforce supporting the defense industrial base. In order to enter the Shipyard/DOD workplace within 14 days of arriving on island, a separate waiver and additional documentation must be submitted through the Government chain of command and approved by the U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander. Such waivers will be submitted and processed only when, at the Government’s sole discretion, it is absolutely necessary. Although the State of Hawaii has partially reinstated the 14-day quarantine period allowing interisland passengers arriving on Oahu to not require to quarantine, effective 11 August 2020, the PHNSY & IMF restrictions remain in effect until further notice. Therefore, contractor employees traveling from outside of the island of Oahu are restricted from entering the DOD workplace for 14 days after arrival. The 14-day period starts from the day the traveler arrived in Oahu. The State of Hawaii’s pre-travel testing program is set to begin on 15 Oct 2020. Under this program, travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 no more than 72 hours before arrival to qualify for an exemption from the state’s quarantine requirement. Although the State of Hawaii’s pre-travel testing program will exempt qualified individuals from the state’s quarantine requirement, PHNSY & IMF’s requirement remains unchanged and travelers coming from off-island are restricted from entering the DOD workplace for 14 days after arrival. ***************************************************************************************************************** CRITERIA RESTRICTIONS FROM ENTERING DOD WORKPLACE Contractor employees meeting any of the six criteria below are restricted from entering the Department of Defense (DOD) workplace: 1. Contractor employees traveling from outside of the island of Oahu are restricted from entering the DOD workplace for 14 days after arrival. 2. Contractor employees with symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache are restricted from entering the DOD workplace. To enter the DOD workplace, the contractor employee shall be asymptomatic for at least 72 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom altering medicines (i.e. cough medicine, etc.) AND at least 14 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. A COVID-19 negative test result will not allow the contractor employee to enter back to the DOD workplace earlier than the 14-day requirement specified above. If contractor employee’s healthcare provider reports that the symptoms are due to NON-COVID-19 illness then the contractor employee shall follow the healthcare provider’s instruction to return to work as opposed to the above requirement (14 days passed) to enter the DOD workplace. A written medical note confirming symptoms are not due to COVID-19 shall be maintained by the contractor employee’s company, and provided to the Government upon request. The medical note shall state that the symptoms are not due to COVID-19. 3. Contractor employees who have others living/staying in their house/hotel room that identified as having COVID-19 are restricted from entering the DOD workplace for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day the contractor employee learns of the cohabitant’s positive testing for COVID-19. A COVID-19 negative test result will not allow the contractor employee to enter back to the DOD workplace earlier than the specified 14-day requirement. 4. Contractor employees testing positive or deemed presumptively positive for COVID-19 by a primary health provider or under the authority of a public health official are restricted from entering the DOD workplace. Contractor shall immediately notify one of the following Contracting Officers: a. Vivian Fukumitsu, 808-368-0881 b. Janet Baker, 808-347-8785 c.

Close contact is defined as: a. Within 6 feet for about 10 minutes regardless of whether the individuals were wearing face coverings, and/or b. Had direct contact with secretions (being coughed on, sneezed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.) Contractor employee experiencing symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache and tests positive or deemed presumptively positive for COVID-19 shall not enter the DOD workplace until at least 21 days have passed since the date of the contractor employee’s last positive COVID-19 test, AND at least 72 hours (3 days) have passed without the contractor employee experiencing or showing symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache and without taking any medications (e.g., Tylenol™ for fever, cough medicine, etc.). If the contractor employee tests positive, but never develops any symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache, the contractor employee may enter the DOD workplace after 21 days have passed since the date of the contractor employee’s last positive COVID-19 test. The contractor employee does NOT have to be tested negative before entering the DOD workplace after 21 days have passed. A COVID-19 negative test result will not allow the contractor employee to enter back to the DOD workplace earlier than the 21-day requirement specified above. Any information related to COVID-19 cases shared by PHNSY with the contractor is not publicly releasable. 5. Contractor employees who have been in close contact (as defined below) with any individual(s) identified in criteria #4 above within 72 hours prior to (a) the individual first exhibiting symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache and/or (b) the date the individual tested positive or was determined as presumptively positive for COVID-19, whichever occurred first, are restricted from entering the DOD workplace. Such contractor employees shall not return to the DOD workplace for 14 days from the date of last contact with the COVID-19 positive/presumptive positive test of the employee they came into contact with. A COVID-19 negative test result will not allow the close contact individual to enter back to the DOD workplace earlier than the 14-day requirement specified above. Close contact is defined as: a. Within 6 feet for about 10 minutes regardless of whether the individuals were wearing face coverings and/or b. Had direct contact with secretions (being coughed on, sneezed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.) Any information related to COVID-19 cases shared by PHNSY with the contractor is not publicly releasable. 6. Contractor employees who are Person Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 (as defined below) are restricted from entering the DOD workplace. Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Office with the number of PUI for COVID-19. Refer to “DAILY COVID-19 REPORT REQUIREMENT & GUIDELINES” below. PUI is defined as an individual: who has been directed/ordered by a healthcare professional to get tested for COVID-19 or currently being tested for COVID-19 as directed/ordered by a healthcare professional and/or waiting for his/her test results. If contractor employee tested negative for COVID-19, but reported experiencing symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache, the contractor employee shall be asymptomatic for at least 72 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom altering medicines (i.e. cough medicine, etc.) AND at least 14 days have passed since symptoms first appeared to enter DOD workplace. If contractor employee tested negative for COVID-19 and had close contact* with a COVID-19 positive/presumptive positive person, the contractor employee shall not return to the DOD workplace for 14 days from the date of last contact with the COVID-19 positive/presumptive positive person they came into contact with. If a contractor employee is NOT experiencing COVID-19/flu-like symptoms AND has NO KNOWN close contact* with a COVID-19 positive case and is being tested for COVID-19 for other reasons (e.g. employee request, pre-surgery testing, employer’s company-wide/random testing for prevention measure, etc.), the contractor employee is NOT restricted from entering the DOD workplace while awaiting test results. The contractor employee may continue to report to the DOD workplace as normal. Contractors DO NOT have to report employees as “Person Under Investigation” or “PUI” under this category to the Contracting Office. *Close contact is defined as: a. Within 6 feet for about 10 minutes regardless of whether the individuals were wearing face coverings, or b. Had direct contact with secretions (being coughed on, sneezed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.) ***************************************************************************** RANDOM WELLNESS & TEMPERATURE SCREENINGS On 13 April 2020, PHNSY will begin executing random wellness and temperature screenings in high-traffic areas to ensure health and safety of all personnel. The screening is very simple and your full cooperation is expected. Some important information about the screenings include the following: The wellness/temperature screening consists of ONE question and a temperature scan The one question is “Are you experiencing flu-like symptoms?” The thermometer will be held between 1-6 inches from your forehead If your forehead is moist or dirty, you may be asked to wipe it off with a provided paper towel so that an accurate reading can be taken The screening uses non-contact infrared thermometers that DO NOT touch you Answering “YES” to the one question or having a temperature reading of 100°F or higher will result in a positive screening If you have a positive screening, you will be asked to leave the shipyard, and contact your supervisor. The screener will notify the Contracting Officer immediately of the contractor employee’s positive screening. The Contracting Officer will contact the company’s point of contact. In accordance with betaSAM.gov notice no. N32253-20-NOTIFICATION-COVID19, contractor employees with symptoms of fever (? 100°), cough, chills, sore throat, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, unexplained muscle pain/aches, and/or unusual headache are restricted from entering the DOD workplace. To enter the DOD workplace, the contractor employee shall be asymptomatic for at least 72 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom altering medicines (i.e. cough medicine, etc.) AND at least 14 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. A COVID-19 negative test result will not allow the individual to enter back to the DOD workplace earlier than the 14-day requirement specified above. If contractor employee’s healthcare provider reports that the symptoms are due to NON-COVID-19 illness then the contractor employee shall follow the healthcare provider’s instruction to return to work as opposed to the written above requirement (14 days passed) to enter the DOD workplace. A written medical note confirming symptoms are not due to COVID-19 shall be maintained by the contractor employee’s company, and provided to the Government upon request. The medical note shall state that the symptoms are not due to COVID-19. If you have a positive screening, the screener will record your information including company name, CAC/badge number, name, and immediate supervisor name Body temperatures greater than 100°F is an indication that the body is fighting a disease. Not all COVID-19 cases have an associated fever. Additionally, a fever can be associated with several other causes to include other medical conditions, severe trauma or injury, and medications. However, in an effort to protect our workforce, if this screening provides positive indication that an individual’s body temperature exceeds 100°F, contractor employees will be advised to leave the shipyard and to notify their supervisor that they were positively screened. **************************************************************************************** CLOTH FACE COVERING REQUIREMENT PHNSY & IMF is expanding the cloth face covering requirement starting 29 Apr 2020. Starting on Wednesday, 29 April 2020, at 12:01 a.m. HST all contractor employees and subcontractor employees in the Controlled Industrial Area (CIA) and/or DOD buildings are required to wear cloth face coverings or commercial disposable masks regardless of the 6 feet of physical (social) distance except as provided in the exceptions listed below. Contractor employees attempting to enter the CIA and DOD buildings without a mask may be turned away until they retrieve their mask. Contractor employees found gathering in the CIA and inside DOD buildings without facemasks may be directed to retrieve their masks. Cloth face coverings or commercial disposable masks are required onboard ships and submarines unless deviations are specifically authorized for tasks where wearing cloth face coverings is impractical (e.g. work required the use of Personal Protective Equipment such as respirators), and the exceptions below do not apply. Contractor employees going shipboard without a cloth face covering will be turned away by ship’s force. Furthermore, all contractor employees are required to wear cloth face coverings or disposable masks outdoors when 6 feet of physical (social) distancing is unlikely or difficult to maintain, except as provided in the exceptions listed below. The below guidelines shall be followed regarding cloth face coverings: Cloth face covering shall be constructed from multiple layers of fabric, and shall be thick enough that light cannot be easily seen passing through the material, but not restricting breathing. Refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidance at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html. Cloth face covering shall cover the nose and mouth. Cloth face covering shall fit snugly against the side of the face, be secured with ties or ear loops, allow for breathing without restriction, and be able to be laundered and machine dried. They should be comfortable as they may need to be worn for prolonged periods of time. All cloth face coverings must have a minimum of two layers of tightly woven material, must fit snugly over the bridge of the nose and around the chin/neck area, and must fully cover the mouth and nose to prevent droplets from escaping. Neck gaiters as face coverings are prohibited as they do not contain moisture in exhaled breath (NAVADMIN 266/20). Further, bandana-type coverings are prohibited because a snug fit over the chin/neck area cannot be achieved. Both neck gaiters and bandana type coverings are prohibited even if they are made from two layers of cloth material. Cloth face covering shall not be shared. Cloth face coverings shall be in good taste and not offensive in appearance. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for any job-specific personal protection equipment. IMPORTANT: Cloth face coverings shall be washed daily. Per CDC guidance, used cloth face coverings should be washed at the end of each day on a gentle cycle and dried at medium heat. Refer to CDC Guidance at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html. IMPORTANT: At the request of security personnel, you shall lower your cloth face covering to verify your identity at base access points, CIA gates, or any other occasion that may require showing your full face for identification purposes. Face masks and coverings with one-way valves embedded in them allow the wearers’ respiratory particulates to escape through the valves, thus defeating the purpose of capturing particulates and droplets when wearers breathe, talk, cough, etc. For this reason, face masks and coverings of any kind that have one-way valves embedded in them are prohibited for wear in the DOD spaces. Exceptions: When working alone at your workstation, office or immediate work area. Facemasks must be donned anytime the contractor employee leaves his/her workspace. When eating or drinking while maintaining six foot physical (social) distancing between you and others. When smoking in a designated smoking location while maintaining six foot physical (social) distancing between you and others. When work processes necessitate the need for respirators or other breathing equipment. Contractor employees who are instructors and briefers may run training courses and briefings without the use of a cloth face coverings provided contractor instructors and briefers are standing behind a physical barrier (e.g., plexiglass pane, plastic curtain) that separates them from the class or audience. If no physical barrier is available, contractor instructors and briefers may wear face shields in lieu of cloth face coverings if all students attending the class continue to wear cloth face coverings. Physical barriers and face shields will provide sufficient protection for instructors and students while allowing instructors to deliver necessary information without being muffled by cloth face coverings. Physical distancing of 6 feet will be maintained to the maximum extent possible at all times. Because of the challenges of properly wearing cloth face coverings when speaking and working in warm/hot temperatures and/or high background noise where clear, loud projection of voice is needed, face shields may be worn in lieu of cloth face coverings in the following specif ic cases where wearers must minimize the duration when maintaining at least 6 feet of distance with others, e.g., passing items, supporting installation or removal of items, etc., is not practicable (Note: cloth face coverings are always required when onboard ships and submarines): (a) When working outdoors such as crane teamwork, building staging, forkliftoperations, emergency response or other command and control type environments where efficient, clear communication is needed for safety and efficiency of response. (b) When operating a forklift during work that requires the operator to repeatedly ingress and egress between the interior and exterior of a building where physical distancing can be maintained by the forklift operator. 7. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings.” As such, the use of face shields in lieu of cloth face coverings as a routine should be kept to a minimum, especially when other physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Face shields must provide a good seal to the forehead area, extend below the chin and wrap around the sides of the face. Face shields will not be shared among employees. 8. When transiting to and from personal vehicles while outside of the Controlled Industrial Area (CIA) and when physical distancing is maintained. (Cloth face coverings must be worn inside the CIA). As a reminder, cloth face coverings DO NOT replace all the other actions required to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We recommend that contractor employees practice physical (social) distancing to the fullest extent possible (6 feet or more between individuals) EVEN WHEN wearing cloth face coverings. Additionally, we recommend that contractor employees wash their hands frequently throughout the day and avoid touching their face. Furthermore, contractor employees may utilize the daily self-screening every day prior to entering DOD workplace. Refer to attachment. ******************************************************************************************* DAILY COVID-19 REPORT REQUIREMENT & GUIDELINES Implementation of the daily COVID-19 report requirement and guidelines below will begin 13 April 2020.

As part of this modernization, CRC needs to grow its multi-level classification computing capability and become a server-agnostic virtualized platform that can adapt to and implement future ABMS software capability. AFLCMC/HBZ is requesting information on and a Rough Order of Magnitude for Cost and Schedule for the development of a prototype virtualized system in the FY2021 timeframe. As an option, you may provide production, and sustainment actions to include two years of Interim Contractor Support (ICS). The virtualized solutions considered must offer the same capabilities of the CRC AN/TYQ-23A Operations Module (OM)."

The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards as this survey is for planning purposes and may not result in a solicitation or contract. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. INSTRUCTIONS: 1. This document contains a description of the Aero-I SATCOM Replacement requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability. 2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). 3. Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business. 4. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged. All submissions will be reviewed IAW FAR Part 19 procedures. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to: Mr. William L. Loftis william.loftis@us.af.mil Ph#: (405) 736-7489 AFLCMC/WKK Building 3001, 3001 Staff Drive, STE 2AJ 85A Tinker AFB, Oklahoma 73145-3001 KC-135 Aero-I SATCOM Replacement PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION The KC-135 utilizes the International Marine/Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) organization's Aeronautical Intermediate (Aero-I) service as part of its Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) system. Aero-I provides oceanic Controller/Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) to Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Aircraft Communications Addressing\Reporting System (ACARS) beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) messages to 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) Global Decision Support System. The installed equipment that provides this communications path is the SRT-2000 Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Transceiver Part Number (P/N) 822-1346-001 and IGA-2000 SATCOM Antenna P/N: 822-1369-001. Both of these items are becoming increasingly unsupportable, resulting in increasing maintenance and Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts (MICAP) hours. In addition, INMARSAT has announced that their Aero-I service will be discontinued as of December 31, 2022. There are 400 C/KC-135 aircraft based throughout the United States (U.S.), Pacific, and Europe that will receive the Aero-I SATCOM Replacement. The KC-135 Aero-I SATCOM Replacement supports mitigating anticipated airspace restrictions within the global Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System, and overall KC-135 shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability. KC-135 Aero-I Replacement will consist of: SATCOM antenna, SATCOM transceiver (receiver/transmitter), and all associated Group A/B components. Projected time-line for KC-135 Aero-I Replacement fielding is FY20 with installs continuing through FY22. Various independent government cost estimates have determined that a solution set utilizing Iridium SATCOM service provides significant lifecycle cost savings and would be preferred over an INMARSAT SATCOM based solution set. The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources possessing the production data/repair data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to provide a replacement solutions(s) and integration of a replacement or upgrade into the current KC-135 SATCOM communications system. The contractor shall have the ability to leverage on-going, planned or future SATCOM system developments that could contribute to reducing total lifecycle cost and risk to the program. ?

This solicitation will result in the award of up to five (5) Design-Build IDIQ MACCs, unless a number more than five (5) is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Construction projects to be performed will primarily consist of general building type projects (new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work) including industrial, airfield, aircraft hangar, aircraft traffic control, infrastructure, administrative, training, dormitory, and community support facilities. All projects will be required to meet sustainable design requirements. The total aggregate value for all contracts to be awarded from any resultant solicitation is $240,000,000 maximum over the base year and all four option periods combined. There is no yearly or per contractor limit except for the total five (5) year maximum. Task orders will be firm fixed-priced, normally in the range of $150,000 to $15,000,000 per order. However, task orders under or over these amounts may be considered if deemed to be in the Governmentâ€™s best interest. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as a competitive requirement open to all qualified firms in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.1, Full and Open Competition. The RFP will be open to participation by interested firms with specialized experience and qualifications required by this contract. The source selection method to be used is a best value continuum process in a negotiated two-phase acquisition utilizing the trade-off approach. Formal two-phase source selection will be used to select the proposals that provide the best value to the Government from a technical and price standpoint. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.1 and 15.3, a trade-off approach to source selection will be used for this solicitation with respect to the initial award. The solicitation evaluation factors for the MACC award will state that for Two-Phase DB procurements, Factors 1-4 (Technical Approach; Experience; Safety; Past Performance) will be evaluated in Phase-One and Factors 2-6 (Experience; Safety; Past Performance; Technical Solution; Energy and Sustainable Design) will be evaluated in Phase-Two. Factor 1 will only be rated Acceptable or Unacceptable. If an Offeror is rated Unacceptable in Factor 1, then they will not be considered for Phase-Two. In making the best value award decision after Phase-Two, the relative order of importance of the non-cost/price evaluation factors is the technical factors (Factors 2, 3, 5, and 6) are of equal importance to each other and, when combined, are equal in importance to the past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment factor (Factor 4). When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the technical factors and past performance/performance confidence assessment factor combined (i.e., the non-cost/price evaluation factors) are approximately equal to price. Offerors selected to proceed to Phase-Two will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for a seed project. Offerors who fail to submit a technical and a price proposal will not be considered for an award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year with four (4) option years and the seed project task order. The remaining four (4) selected offerors will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year and four (4) option years with a minimum guarantee of $1,000.00 over the five (5) year period. There is currently no seed project identified for this solicitation. A seed project will be identified at commencement of Phase-Two. Contract award is anticipated on or around Aug 2017. This will be an electronic solicitation, which can be downloaded from Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov The solicitation will be available at this site no earlier than 15 days after this pre-solicitation notice is posted.
